I personally managed Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU , an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old man with a history of respiratory failure , ARDS , pneumonia and also an underlying history of dementia .
The patient continues to be mottled and with poor cardiac output .
His urine output now is decreasing on Lasix .
His chest x-ray is continuing to show evidence of severe ARDS .
He is growing strep for which he is on appropriate antibiotics .
We have not been able to aggressively reverse this situation .
He appears to be in poor condition .
We are now discussing with the family the possibility of comfort measures as the patient is not responding to aggressive treatment .
We are continuing to discuss this with the family and the attending physician .
