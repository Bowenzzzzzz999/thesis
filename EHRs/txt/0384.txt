ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 10 2008]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 13 08]
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old male postoperative day number three from laryngectomy .
I am currently managing this critically ill patient in the Transplant ICU for respiratory failure , pulmonary edema , hypertension , and COPD .
I have examined Mr. **NAME[AAA] both in the morning and afternoon today and I have personally reviewed the patient 's medications as well as all the historical , laboratory , microbiologic and radiologic data pertinent to his care .
All ICU management has been given under my direction .
The patient has been stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint overnight but continues to require mechanical ventilation for respiratory support .
He has been difficult to wean from the ventilator previously .
PROBLEMS :
1. Respiratory failure with pulmonary edema .
The patient 's oxygen saturation is 98% on AC mode with a rate of 12 , 40% FIO2 , tidal volume of 600 and PEEP of 5 .
Chest x-ray shows severe COPD with pulmonary venous congestions and a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .
Given that the patient 's white blood cell count is unremarkable and the patient has been afebrile , I suspect that the infiltrate is due to volume overload rather to an infection .
I have therefore given Lasix 20 mg IV times one and will place the patient on a trach mask trial today .
Overnight , given the patient 's COPD , I will maintain oxygen saturations between 90 and 95% .
This will likely mean reducing the FIO2 from 40% to 30 or even 25% .
2. Hypertension .
The patient 's blood pressure is slightly high at 170/80 .
The patient is already on his regular antihypertensive medications including metoprolol and Univasc .
I suspect that his hypertension may be due simply to volume overload and I will wait to see how the diuresis affects the blood pressure before I add an additional medication .
I have otherwise continued current care including Pepcid and heparin for ICU prophylaxis .
I have continued enteral nutrition with Crucial at 45 mL / hour , discontinued the arterial line and decreased the sliding scale insulin to a low dose scale q. 6 hours for glycemic control .
The time I have spent managing this patient today , exclusive of teaching time and billable procedures , is 40 minutes .
