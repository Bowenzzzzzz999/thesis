HISTORY
Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old female patient known to Dr. **NAME[TTT] at the **INSTITUTION who was originally admitted through the emergency room of **STREET-ADDRESS **NAME[SSS] on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .
The patient lives at home by herself and is checked on routinely by neighbors and Meals On Wheels .
Neighbors found the patient seated on the floor in front of the couch upon their visit on the day of admission .
It was unknown how long the patient had been on the floor .
Paramedics were called and the patient was transferred to the emergency room at **STREET-ADDRESS **NAME[SSS] .
On discussion with the neighbors , it was discovered that this same incident occurred the day prior as well , only at this time the patient was found seated on the floor beside the bed .
Paramedics were called at this time as well and the patient refused treatment and transport at that time .
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was noted to be stable .
The patient denied any symptoms of light - headedness , dizziness , loss of consciousness , palpitations , fevers , or chills .
The patient had been suffering from congestion , rhinorrhea , and cough for the past several days .
She noted that she had been getting increasingly weak with this viral syndrome that she had been experiencing the past few days , but denied ever becoming light - headed , dizzy , or short of breath .
On admission workup , the patient was noted to have a white count of 14.8 and the remainder of her admission laboratory workup was negative .
Head CT was performed , which noted small vessel disease , mucosal changes in the sinuses , and no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or stroke .
A chest x-ray at that time was negative for any acute disease in the chest .
HOSPITAL COURSE
In light of this unwitnessed fall along with white count , dehydration , and weakness , the patient was admitted to **STREET-ADDRESS **NAME[SSS] for treatment of acute sinusitis .
She was initiated with a five-day course of azithromycin .
The patient was also rehydrated with IV fluids initially .
The patient responded well to antibiotic therapy and rehydration .
