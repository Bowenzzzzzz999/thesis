I responded to Condition A on 10 South .
Patient is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman with past medical history of dementia , peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the hospital for ischemic leg .
The patient was evaluated by Vascular Surgery and he was diagnosed with DVT with the common femoral vein .
Apparently , patient 's history was complicated by atrial fibrillation and he has been treated with calcium channel blockers .
Apparently , just prior to calling the code , the patient became bradycardic on the monitor and the code was called .
On our arrival , the patient was unresponsive and he was treated using ACLS protocol , a note of which will be dictated separately .
The patient 's initial rhythm was PA , pulseless electrical activity and subsequently had rhythms of asystole , ventricular fibrillation which was resistant to treatment .
The patient was given epinephrine , a total of 5 mg .
He was given 1 mg of atropine .
He was shocked five times from 150 joules to 200 joules .
He was given calcium chloride and bicarb and also was treated for a possible hyperkalemia .
The patient was resuscitated for almost half - an - hour and the code was called off due to futility of care .
The possible causes of his cardiopulmonary arrest is pulmonary embolism , a massive myocardial infarction .
The code was called off by myself and the family were on their way to the hospital .
The medical attending and the family will be notified by the medical team .
I have told the senior resident that I will be more than happy to come and talk to the family when they arrive .
I do not think the patient is going to require an autopsy .
However , I told the medical resident that this is an option that they need to talk to the family about .
I spent a total of 30 minutes assessing , evaluating , managing Mr. **NAME[AAA] .
