I was called to see Mr. **NAME[AAA] emergently as part of a condition C response .
The condition C was called for hypertension , tachycardia , rigor , and dyspnea .
When I arrived , the patient was being attended to by the critical care fellow and ICU nurse and the patient 's bedside nursing staff as well as a surgery resident .
The patient 's blood pressure was 220/120 .
His pulse was 146 in what appeared to be sinus tachycardia .
His respiratory rate was 44 .
he was on a rebreather face mask at 15 liters and he was 100% saturated .
The patient was awake , alert , and oriented .
He denied pain or chills .
He had rigor of the upper extremities but not of the lower .
The patient denied pain or difficulty breathing .
He had no chest pain .
There was no cough .
On my examination , the patient was somewhat pale but his color was not cyanotic ; in fact , he was slightly pink .
He was not flushed .
There was no skin rash .
His neurologic exam was intact .
His lungs were clear bilaterally .
His heart rate was rapid and regular .
His abdomen was slightly distended and reported as not being different from previous .
It was nontender .
There was no rebound .
There were bowel sounds .
He had no peripheral edema and no acrocyanosis .
We checked the patient 's morning labs which had been drawn only several hours earlier and noted no significant abnormalities .
I did note that the white blood cell count had increased from roughly 3000 to roughly 5000 .
We drew a blood gas which was not abnormal , and I decided to treat the patient 's hypertension and tachycardia with Lopressor .
I dosed him 2.5 mg every 3 minutes or so , giving him ultimately a total dose of 25 mg .
With this intervention , the patient 's pulse decreased from 146 down to 115 .
His blood pressure decreased down to 142/80 .
His respiratory rate decreased from 46 to 30 and the patient said that he did feel more comfortable with his breathing after the infusion of these medicines .
The surgery resident ordered 4 grams of magnesium which was infused as well .
We were concerned that this may be a medication event; however , the patient has only received Dilaudid since midnight .
He has tolerated Dilaudid well in the past and this did not appear to be a histamine reaction in any case , so I discount this as a possibility .
I was able to rapidly wean the patient 's FiO2 down to 4 liters of nasal cannula with 100% saturation .
He had no pulmonary complaints , so I do not believe pulmonary embolus is a cause .
It appears rather that this was some sort of catecholamine storm .
I am unclear as to the etiology but my best suspicion is that he may be having incipient sepsis .
His temperature is 38.5 .
There has been a bump in his white count and this occurred about an hour or so after having his biliary duct catheter flushed .
I spoke to the surgery fellow and we agreed to resume treatment with antibiotics .
I have asked for either Zosyn or Unasyn along with Flagyl , treating abdominal pathogens as well as C. difficile .
The patient has been complaining of diarrhea .
A CT scan has also been ordered by us , looking for an abdominal fluid collection which , if found , should be tapped .
I have moved the patient to the Intensive Care Unit because of his vital sign abnormalities and because it is unclear to me what the etiology of such a severe vital sign derangement is .
A chest x-ray has been ordered and has only just been taken ; I will check that .
I personally assisted transporting the patient to the 6G Intensive Care Unit and making sure he was stabilized there prior to leaving .
The total time taken in the care of this critically ill patient was 75 minutes .
