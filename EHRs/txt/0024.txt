I am seeing this critically ill woman for management of respiratory insufficiency and atrial fibrillation .
I have examined the patient , reviewed the laboratory data , chest x-ray film , and events of the evening .
She underwent pulmonic valve repair yesterday , went back to the OR for bleeding after multiple units of blood were given .
Bleeding was terminated in the OR .
She has done well .
From a respiratory standpoint , she has bilateral infiltrates still , but her Aa gradient is reasonable and has come down to 40% , 5 of PEEP , and she looks fairly comfortable on CPAP .
She has a PO2 of 111 .
She is only positive of about a liter at this point , given good urinary input as well as the bleeding that she had .
I would favor giving her a trial of extubation .
She has an ASD repair .
Will start her ultimately on some aspirin .
She had some rapid atrial fibrillation last evening .
She has been on Cardizem , and I have asked to wean that off .
She is currently in a sinus rhythm .
She is warm and well perfused .
Continue with GI prophylaxis .
Keep the chest tubes in place at this point .
T = 30
