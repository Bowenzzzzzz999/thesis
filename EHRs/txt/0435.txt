I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male status post repair of an SMA false aneurysm .
Hospital course has been complicated by malnutrition , respiratory insufficiency , fluid overload , and postoperative cholestasis .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and Emtek data , and discussed the management with the vascular and general surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory insufficiency .
Chest x-ray continues to show pulmonary vascular congestion .
I have given him another 20 mg of Lasix today .
Clinically , his respiratory pattern is improved and I am weaning his oxygen down .
He is diuresing nicely with Lasix and we will keep him the intensive care unit for pulmonary toileting .
2. Status post SMA repair .
We will continue a five - day course of Cipro , Flagyl , and vancomycin empirically .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit have been stable .
I have discontinued the q.6 hourly hematocrit checks .
He does have a little bit of what I think is postoperative cholestasis with an increase in his total bilirubin from a preoperative level of 6 to a postoperative level of 10 .
We will check that on a daily basis .
Right upper quadrant shows no signs of ductal dilatation .
Gastroenterology is following closely .
3. Malnutrition .
I have started him back up on his TPN .
He did not do well on trickle tube feeds last night and had an episode of vomiting , and I have discontinued his tube feeding .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
