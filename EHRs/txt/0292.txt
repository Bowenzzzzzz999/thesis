My own interpretation of the chest radiograph is The radiograph shows a bilateral alveolar infiltrate .
The patient 's radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly .
ETT noted  .
Assessment :
My management of this critically ill patient in the MICU today has included the following :
Respiratory :
The patient has clinical findings consistent with an aspiration pneumonia , The patient 's current ventilator parameters are acceptable .
I will not proceed with weaning today until the patient is more alert and cooperative .
Clinical picture c/w CHF and pneumonia .
q 4hr nebs with duoneb and pulmicort .
Hold on systemic corticosteroids .
Check CXR in AM , repeat ABG .
Given frequency of bouts of respiratory failure will need to strongly consider trach for long term manangent  .
Cardiovascular :
Pulmonary edema .
Follow enzymes , ECG with with T wave inversions precordial leads .
Cardiogy consult .
IV heparin , ASA  .
Renal / Electrolytes :
The patient has renal function within acceptable limits at this time .
GI / Nutrition :
The patient 's abdominal exam is currently within acceptable limits , The patient 's evaluation suggests normal GI function .
I will initiate feeding within the next 24 hours if we do not progress to extubation .
Infectious Disease :
Severe community acquired pneumonia with copious thick discolored secretions .
Begin empiric antibiotics with vanco , cefepime , zithro , panculture .
MRSA isolation .
Neurology :
The patient has evidence for a metabolic encephalopathy , severe hypercapnia contributing to obtundation  .
Endocrine :
Diagnosis , The patient 's recent blood sugar results were reviewed and I have revised the insulin coverage .
Hematology :
Anemia eval  .
Psychosocial :
I have reviewed the patient 's advance directive
The patient is to continue as full support .
