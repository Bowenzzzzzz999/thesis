I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male who has the complications of gallstone pancreatitis currently with an abdominal phlegmon , possible bile leak and now with sepsis and ARDS .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the Vascular and General surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Sepsis .
Over the last 24 hours , I have been able to wean his norepinephrine off .
He feels warm , dry , and well perfused peripherally on examination , although he is becoming somewhat more edematous with his capillary leak .
In terms of his antibiotics , Infectious Disease is now recommending a switch from Tigecycline to linezolid and I have started him on meropenem as we stopped Tigecycline to maintain broad spectrum , Gram-negative , and anaerobic coverage .
I have left him on his _________ in light of his multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas and the MIC 's on the
Pseudomonas have returned and it is sensitive to __________ .
I have ordered some repeat blood cultures today to make sure that we have cleared his sepsis .
His PTC catheter is in place and draining well .
2. Respiratory failure / ARDS .
Chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates and a tracheal tube is in good position .
Bronchoalveolar lavage is so far unremarkable .
Today , I have tried to wean his FiO2 down as tolerated , but he has not done well with that .
I have him on a tidal volume of 350 with a rate of 20 giving his peak airway pressures in the low 30 's .
Arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.25 and a pO2 of 77 , both of which are adequate given his severe lung disease .
3. Status post SMA aneurysm repair .
I have him back on his heparin drip .
PTT is 35 and we are increasing gradually .
4. ICU prophylaxis .
I have placed him back on his TPN and started him on some q. 6 hourly sliding - scale insulin .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
