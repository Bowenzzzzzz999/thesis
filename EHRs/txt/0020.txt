This is a patient , who just arrived to 4G ICU , transferred from the trauma room after she was involved in a motor vehicle collision .
She is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old woman who was found to have a possible C3 spine fracture .
The patient was involved in an unrestrained driver collision with a severe laceration of the head .
She had a CT of the head that showed a very small subarachnoid hemorrhage .
The initial x-ray workup included a chest CT and abdominal CT .
This does not appear to show any abnormalities ; however , her hematocrit had dropped to 25 since she came to the trauma room .
She is on Plavix for possible cardiac disease .
She has a history of having had a coronary bypass .
When the patient arrived in the ICU she was borderline hypotensive with the blood pressure ranging between 98 and 85 systolic .
She received two boluses of 250 of Hespan and she had a central line in the femoral vein placed under my supervision and an arterial line in the femoral artery also placed under my supervision .
We elected to place these groin lines because the patient is on Plavix and at this point we will not proceed with the subclavian line , at least for the time being .
We will transfuse her with 6 units of platelets and we will transfuse her with two units of red cells .
The Spine Service will see her to establish and plan further management of a possible spine fracture .
Neurosurgery has already seen her and has not recommended any further intervention at this point except for observation .
The patient will be managed and controlled with Fentanyl and a small dose of Propofol while she is on the ventilator .
Because the patient now has some degree of hemodynamic instability , we will proceed with an EKG and a STAT echocardiogram to address the possibility of myocardial ischemia , we will also request a number of troponins , and we will review the EKG .
She remains with a heart rate of about 70 .
She may be under beta blocker and she may have some underlying cardiac disease , which will need to be investigated over the next few hours .
After the bolus of 500 mL of Hespan , her pressure is 115 right now .
She will remain in the ICU on the ventilator .
We will continue to monitor her hemodynamic status carefully .
We will review the films and rule out other sources of bleeding .
We will obtain a cardiology consult and if she continues to have evidence of cardiac ischemia .
I , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , was present for her assessment and dictation for 35 minutes at the bedside plus a central line in the vein and arterial line in the femoral artery .
