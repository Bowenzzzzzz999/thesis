DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Giant cell arteritis .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
1. Hypertension .
2. Anemia of chronic disease .
**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :
This is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who presents with multiple generalized complaints of fatigue , weakness , headache , weight loss , shortness of breath , palpitations , muscle aches , numbness , and tingling who was recently hospitalized with low - grade fevers and leukocytosis for which an extensive workup was undertaken with no source or etiology of her leukocytosis or symptoms identified .
This workup included a tagged white blood cell scan , a EMG , and a PET scan .
Of note , the patient was scheduled to have an outpatient temporal artery biopsy , but failed to follow up with this appointment .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Giant cell arteritis .
The patient carried a questionable diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she had not been treated recently .
Given her multiple complaints and history of vitiligo , we continued to pursue an autoimmune explanation for her constellation of symptoms .
We did obtain a Rheumatology consult who recommended temporal artery biopsy while an inpatient .
The patient underwent temporal artery biopsy on **DATE[Sep 10 2007] .
The procedure was a bilateral temporal artery biopsy and was without complications .
Pathology performed on this specimen was consistent with giant cell arteritis .
The patient was started on prednisone 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was scheduled for followup with Rheumatology .
2. Dizziness .
The patient continued to complain of significant dizziness , which appeared to be positional in nature .
Her symptoms and signs are most consistent with benign positional vertigo , but given Rheumatology 's assessment that she had some asymmetric sensory abnormality on exam , we evaluated the patient with MRA of the internal auditory canals which revealed nonspecific signal changes seen in the pons in the hemispheric white matter consistent with small vessel disease .
No specific evidence of intracanicular acoustic neuroma was identified .
The patient is to have followup with **INSTITUTION .
3. Hypertension .
The patient has a history of hypertension .
We will resume the patient 's home medications , which she was probably not taking and her hypertension was well controlled while an inpatient .
4. Anemia .
The patient was felt to be anemic .
It was felt that her anemia was likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease .
However , she also had some component of iron - deficiency anemia .
We did start the patient on iron supplements and counseled her that she is to have age - appropriate cancer screening .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Prednisone 30 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Actonel 35 mg p.o. q. Fridays .
3. Iron sulfate 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Prilosec 30 mg p.o. q. day .
5. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. day .
6. Os - Cal D 2 tablets p.o. q. day .
7. Valsartan 40 mg p.o. q. day .
8. Vicodin 1 tablet by mouth q.6 hours as needed for pain .
