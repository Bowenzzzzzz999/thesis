I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternal wound infection and debridement .
Her hospital course has been complicated by respiratory insufficiency .

1. Sternal wound infection :
The patient is going to the operating room today for debridement .
I have her on vancomycin and cefepime to cover her gram - negative rods and gram - positive cocci in the culture .
White blood cell count is up today at 23,000 , which is somewhat concerning .
There have been no fevers .
I have given her 1 unit of packed red blood cells for hemoglobin of 8 and hematocrit of 24 .
2. Respiratory failure :
Chest x-ray shows some increase in the bilateral effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion .
On the vent , I have her on assist control .
Her peak airway pressures , minute ventilation and gas exchange have been adequate .
In light of her trip back to the operating room today , I have left her on full mechanical ventilatory support .
