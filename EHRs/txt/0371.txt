MRI of the brain with extensive white matter abnormalities with features compatible with the patient 's known diagnosis of multiple sclerosis .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Ms. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year-old African-American female who presented to the Emergency Department on **DATE[Feb 30 07] complaining of increasing falls and ataxia over the last several days .
She has a past medical history of multiple sclerosis diagnosed in 1995 , hypertension , status post hysterectomy .
Again she really only complains of increasing falling at home but denied any fever , chills , chest pain , dysuria and diarrhea .
She did endure some increased urinary frequency and generalized weakness .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 139 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 102 , CO2 29 , BUN 11 , creatinine 0.7 , calcium 8.7 , magnesium 1.9 , phosphate 3.5 , B12 351 , folate 557 .

Blood cultures were negative x 1 day .
Urine culture grew greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli and it was resistant to Bactrim and Doxycycline .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted to the floor for further treatment of her urinary tract infection and for PT evaluation .
She was initially started on Cipro ; however , the IV antibiotic management team recommended that she should be on Unasyn and told to narrow her antibiotics .
She stayed on Unasyn for close to 2 days and when her urine sensitivities were back , we discharged her on Amoxicillin .
The patient did endorse that she was feeling a bit more steady on her feet and having less weakness .
We were concerned that she may be having worsening of her multiple sclerosis with her history of increasing falls .
A MRI of her brain was checked as noted above .
We did speak with her neurologist , Dr. **NAME[UUU] and he does not want to start her on any steroids and recommended outpatient follow up .
She was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and they thought that she could benefit from even outpatient physical therapy .
The patient adamantly refuses any therapy upon discharge .
