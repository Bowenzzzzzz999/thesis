CONSULTS :
1. Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] , Cardiology .
2. Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] , Cardiothoracic Surgery .
3. The intensivist .
PRIMARY ADMISSION DIAGNOSES :
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis .
2. Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction .
3. Renal artery stenosis , status post stenting .
4. Mitral regurgitation 4 + .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
1. Coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypass graft 6 years ago , status post myocardial infarction at the presentation of this admission .
2. Diabetes type 2 .
3. Cardiomyopathy .
4. Congestive heart failure .
5. Hypertension .
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease .
7. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
8. Degenerative joint disease .
Significant procedures done for the patient while on admission are as follows :
1. Echocardiogram on **DATE[May 2 2007] , which showed moderate LV dysfunction with segmental abnormalities .
a. Normal left ventricular chamber size .
b. Aortic valve sclerosis .
c. Moderate mitral valve insufficiency .
d. Mild tricuspid insufficiency .
e. Moderate pulmonary hypertension .
2. Cardiac catheterization **DATE[Dec 5 2007] , during which she has left heart catheterization for coronary angiography , left ventriculogram , renal arteriogram , and right heart catheterization .
The findings are as follows :
a. Severe three-vessel coronary artery disease .
b. Patent LIMA graft to the LAD .
c. Saphenous vein graft distal to the right coronary artery .
d. Occluded saphenous vein graft to the probable obtuse marginal branch .
e. Severe mitral regurgitation .
f. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with basal inferior wall hypokinesis .
g. Pulmonary hypertension which is likely due to mitral valve disease .
h. MR 4 +. i .
Left renal artery stenosis 90% .
3. Left renal artery stent by Interventional Radiology .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year-old lady with past medical history listed below who was admitted with DKA secondary to non - Q - wave MI .
Apparently , the patient checked blood glucose at home which showed critical high , after which she presented to the emergency room .
Was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydrated .
She was then admitted to the ICU for malignant of DKA .
However , her troponin level was noted to have increased from 1.89 to 5.19 with increase in CPK from 160 to 240 and CPK-MB from 5.7 to
12.6 .
The patient was rehydrated and medically managed in the ICU , after which she underwent cardiac catheterization with the above report .
Throughout the episodes of illness , the patient denied any chest pain .
She had mild shortness of breath and generalized weakness .
The patient 's condition improved very well during the admission .
During the cardiac catheterization , she was noted to have left renal artery stenosis up to 90% for which she had cardiac catheterization as described above .
A recommendation was made for her to have her mitral valve regurgitation repair ; however , the patient declined the procedure stating that her mother had mitral valve regurgitation and she lived for many years without having any problem .
The patient also had a carotid Doppler done which showed 0 to 39% on both sides .
The patient was managed on the following issues during admission and discharge :
1. DKA .
The patient 's diabetic ketoacidosis was secondary to the non - Q - wave MI as mentioned above .
She was initially managed on insulin infusion .
Later on , switched to insulin sliding scale .
She is going to be discharged home on home medication which is Humulin 70/30 insulin , 40 units , a.c. before breakfast and then 28 units a.c. before dinner .
She will continue to check her insulin glucose at home .
2. Coronary artery disease .
The patient has had CABG in the past , that was about 6 to 7 years ago .
She has graft ( _______________ ) native vessels occluded OM circumflex done .
Estimated EF is 25% .
There are no symptoms of pulmonary hypertension .
No edema or CHF .
At the moment , she is in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy .
a. She has high risk for OHS due to comorbidities .
b. If she agrees to surgery , we need to do surgery with antiplatelets on board which will lead to more transfusion .
c. She will benefit from dual - chamber biventricular ICD regardless of whether she has the OHS or not .
d. Her left ventricle is dilated and weak .
Even when the mitral regurgitation is fixed , this will lead to increase afterload to the left ventricle .
This will place more strain on the already weak heart ; so , the recommendations are we change the metoprolol to Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
We will avoid aldosterone antagonist as this will likely affect her potassium which is already on the high side .
There is a question of if left circumflex system could be revascularized if she happens to go to the OR for the mitral valve replacement ; so , the patient will go home on the medications listed below to follow up with Cardiology .
3. Renal artery stenosis .
For this , she had a renal stent as stated above .
We will monitor her potassium levels .
Her renal function is normal at the moment .
4. Hypertension .
Blood pressure is stable at the moment .
We will continue her on the Coreg .
Monitor her blood pressure as needed .
5. Diabetes type 2 .
She will go home on her usual medications .
6. History of CHF .
For this , we will continue her on the digoxin .
The patient is being discharged home on the following medications :
1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily .
2. Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily .
4. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily .
5. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily .
6. Humulin insulin 70/30 , 40 units in the a.m. , 28 units in p.m.
7. Zocor 40 mg p.o. daily .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. **NAME[RRR QQQ] as an outpatient at the **INSTITUTION , **INSTITUTION .
She will follow up with Cardiology as an outpatient as well .
The cardiologist had a long discussion with the patient 's son as regards the need for the procedure , the risk , and the benefit .
At the moment , they are undecided on whether she is going to get a procedure or not .
