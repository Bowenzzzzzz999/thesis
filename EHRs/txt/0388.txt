EVALUATION DATE :

CONDITION C:
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old patient who was admitted under the Renal Transplant service .
This is a woman with a history of chronic renal failure who has had two failed kidney transplants in the past .
She came with what appeared to be an abdominal wound infection for which she had placed a VAC in the surgical wound , and she was eventually transferred to Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] 's service , and she was seen by one of these two physicians early today .
The patient was found to have a blood pressure of 73/40 .
They have requested that the patient get an IV bolus .
The patient had very poor IV access .
They had requested that the IV team had a new attempt for IV access .
This was not successful .
Then they requested that the patient have a PICC line , which was not successful , and four hours later while the patient continued to have a blood pressure of about 72/40 , we were asked to see this patient .
A condition C was called because of persistent hypotension and inability to obtain IV access .
When I saw the patient on the floor , the patient was awake and alert with adequate mentation .
Her blood pressure was 78/40 .
We measured her blood pressure in only one arm because she has a fistula in the left arm .
She had a good pulse in the femoral region , and she never had any compromise in mentation .
She was complaining of abdominal pain .
I proceeded to place a femoral line in the left femoral vein .
This was done with some difficulty because the patient has a history of previous cut - downs in this area .
She had some scars in this area .
We put in a triple - lumen catheter without complication with no hematoma into her left femoral vein , and we were able to give her a couple of boluses of IV fluids .
Her blood pressure improved .
Her oxygen saturation remained about 100% .
Once the line was placed , I re - examined the patient , and she complained of progressive worsening abdominal pain with some guarding in the lower right quadrant .
This appeared to be a new finding according to her nurse practitioner , although none of these findings had been reported earlier today .
The patient was transferred immediately to a CCU MICU bed for her to be aggressively resuscitated and for her to be studied for possible intra - abdominal sepsis .
I requested that she have an abdominal CT when she is more stable .
I , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , was present during the entire resuscitation for a total of 32 minutes .
This is not including the time that I spent placing the central line .
CPT-99291 , central line .
