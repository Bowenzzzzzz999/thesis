FINAL DIAGNOSES :
1. Acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction which began on the evening of **DATE[Oct 27 2007] .
2. Severe multivessel coronary artery disease .
3. The patient has a history of 5 previous myocardial infarctions .
4. In **DATE[Apr 2005] , the patient underwent multivessel coronary artery bypass surgery .
5. The patient had several coronary interventions done prior to his bypass surgery in 2004 .
6. Hypertension , treated .
7. Hypercholesterolemia .
8. Hypothyroidism .
9. Persistent tobacco abuse .
10. Status post cervical laminectomy .
11. The patient is relatively noncompliant .
HISTORY :
This patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman with severe premature coronary artery disease .
Apparently , his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of **AGE[in 40s] , and he had a brother who also suffered a myocardial infarction at 48 .
All the siblings in the family have a history of hypertension .
This patient developed a symptomatic coronary artery disease several years ago .
He had coronary stents placed by another cardiologist but neither apparently maintained satisfactory patency and subsequently , the patient underwent multivessel bypass surgery in **DATE[Apr 2005] .
We were told it was 7 - vessel bypass surgery but the exact grafts were not currently available .
The patient developed chest pain on the evening of **DATE[Oct 21 2007] .
It began at rest .
It was fairly significant .
He presented to the emergency room where his first enzymes were really not elevated but the patient had ST - T wave changes in the lateral leads of the electrocardiogram .
Subsequent to that , he was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Please check the admitting note .
There are no additions to that note .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission to the hospital , the patient was started on heparin and oral Plavix or clopidogrel .
He had a repeat troponin I done at 10:30 a.m. on **DATE[Oct 22 2007] , and that clearly showed a marked elevation in his troponin to 17.5 .
For that reason , a decision was made to take the patient to the catheterization laboratory .
The patient went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on **DATE[Oct 22 2007] .
Despite his very ominous finding past medical history including the history of five previous myocardial infarctions , this patient still has an ejection fraction estimated at 50% .
His grafts include the following :
The patient has a patent sequential LIMA to the diagonal and to a left anterior descending artery .
No progression of the disease in the native left anterior descending artery beyond this LIMA graft .
He has a dominant circumflex artery .
There is a totally occluded vein graft to a medium sized ramus intermedius artery .
This is presumably the acute event .
He had a patent vein graft to fairly large obtuse marginal artery but this obtuse marginal artery had proximal 80% stenosis which prevented adequate retrograde filling of the dominant circumflex artery .
The same circumflex artery has a long segmental distal 80% stenosis which is a critical lesion which will require attention in the near future .
The right coronary artery is a codominant vessel in that it supplies a small posterior descending branch .
There is a remote stent in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery which has abruptly occluded shortly after the stent .
There is a small vein graft into a right ventricular branch which sends some collaterals to the distal portion of the occluded right coronary artery but the amount of collateralization is not very prominent .
Finally , a prominent proximal conus branch which is fairly large caliber vessel has segmental 90% lesions .
On this occasion , we were able to reopen the totally occluded vein graft to the ramus intermedius artery .
This graft was filled with thrombus .
We had to use a thrombectomy catheter with multiple passes before I put in 2 sequential Taxus 3.5 mm drug eluting stents with good results in the graft but this vein graft has distal anastomotic 50% stenosis .
The patient had adequate flow through the vein graft into the obtuse marginal artery .
He was treated with intravenous eptifibatide and continued on potent antiplatelet agents .
The day after the procedure , he was completely asymptomatic even with ambulation in the hall and was chomping at the bid to go home .
He has normal sinus rhythm at 74 per minute .
His total CPK peaked at 482 with an MB fraction that peaked at 23.7.
This would fit with the fact that the ramus intermedius artery is not a very large vessel and even occlusion of this vessel would not be expected to produce a large infarct .
The patient will be allowed to go home on a good medical therapy , and he will follow up in 3 to 4 weeks at which time I will reassess the stented vein graft , and I plan on putting a drug eluting stent in the distal portion of the dominant circumflex artery as this is the more worrisome lesion with his current anatomy .
The patient actually forgot to tell the staff when I came in that he was on thyroid replacement therapy , so he did not get his medicine for a couple of days .
When I mentioned this to he and his girlfriend , I got the impression he had not been taking it faithfully at home .
This may account for the fact that his lipids have been too elevated .
In addition , the patient was back to smoking cigarettes and tells me he has now stopped smoking completely .
I hope that he sticks to that resolution as this patient has fairly significant diffuse disease and if the progression is not stopped , his long - term outlook will be guarded .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
The discharge medications on this occasion are the following :
1. Acetaminophen 650 mg p.r.n.
2. Enteric - coated aspirin 325 mg daily .
3. Plavix 75 mg daily .
4. Lipitor 80 mg daily .
5. Add omega-3 fish oil supplement 2000 mg daily .
6. Add lisinopril 10 mg daily at bedtime .
7. Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.
8. Multivitamin 1 daily .
9. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg tablet sublingually p.r.n.
10. Protonix 40 mg daily or omeprazole 20 mg daily as needed for reflux esophagitis .
Because of the institution of lisinopril , he will need to check his BUN , creatinine and electrolytes in 2 to 3 weeks .
ACTIVITY :
I told the patient he could not return to work or do heavy lifting until he returns to get stenting of the circumflex artery which will be approximately 3 weeks .
I made it a point to explain to him the importance of taking his medicines exactly as prescribed and to stop smoking cigarettes completely .
