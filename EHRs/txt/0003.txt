The patient has had a relatively prolonged stay due to the severe nature of her asthmatic bronchitis and the COPD complication .
Her blood pressures have remained fairly well controlled in spite of the therapies and the patient at this point is relatively free of disease .
The patient 's chest x-ray does not show any evidence of pneumonia , but the patient does have crepitations at both bases , more pronounced on the left , and this will need to have further followup to make sure that she is not still harboring some degree of congestion .
The patient will be seen within the week .
