TRANSFER DIAGNOSIS ( ES ) :
PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS ( ES ):
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS ( ES ):
1. Congestive heart failure exacerbation .
2. Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease .
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old male veteran who gets his primary care at the **INSTITUTION in the **PLACE Section of **PLACE who has a history of chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of approximately 2.3 , hypertension and CVA and peripheral vascular disease , presented initially to the **INSTITUTION with some lightheadedness , nausea , fatigue , and two brief episodes of chest pain .
The patient was found to be initially in an junctional rhythm .
The initial troponin there was negative and the patient was subsequently transferred to the **INSTITUTION Emergency Department , as there were no beds available at the **INSTITUTION .
LABORATORY , RADIOGRAPHIC AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC STUDY FINDINGS :
Procedures Performed / Studies obtained :
Ventilation perfusion scan of lungs and on **DATE[Feb 24 2007] which was low probability for pulmonary embolism .
Bilateral lower extremities Doppler 's studies done on **DATE[Feb 26 2007] which was negative for evidence of deep venous thrombosis .
Upper extremity Doppler 's done on **DATE[Feb 24 2007] negative for evidence of deep venous thrombosis .
CT scan of upper extremity done on **DATE[Feb 24 2007] which showed fluid within the independent portion of the distal arm likely represents dependent edema given fluid location , and underlying abscess could not be excluded without assessment of IV contrast .
Transthoracic echocardiogram done on **DATE[Feb 26 2007] which showed mildly dilated left ventricle with severely hypokinetic posterior wall and mildly decreased systolic function within his estimated ejection fraction of 45 to
50% , moderate MR , moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated PA systolic of 54 mm and mild LAE and mild TR .
Adenosine myocardial perfusion study done on **DATE[Mar 02 2007] which showed a high probability of coronary disease and ischemia and a large area of moderate severity .
There is defects visualized suggesting the presence of triple vessel coronary artery disease , ejection fraction of 46% , defects are visualized in mid LAD distribution on obtuse marginal distribution and RCA distribution .
Cardiac catheterization done on **DATE[Mar 05 2007] which showed left main with no disease , LAD with mid 80% stenosis just after take off of moderate diagonal branches .
Left circumflex with proximal subtotal occlusion gives off moderate sized OM - 1 and small to moderate sized OM - 2 which was seen filling faintly with left to left and right to left collaterals .
RCA dominant with mid 70 to 80% stenosis with right to left collaterals to the left circumflex OM distribution .
There were multiple chest x-rays .
Chest x-ray done on **DATE[Feb 18] and **DATE[Feb 23] which showed lungs to appear clear and chest x-ray done on **DATE[Feb 28] which shows interstitial pulmonary edema which resolved by chest x-ray on **DATE[Feb 21 2007] .
Therapeutic thoracentesis done on **DATE[Feb 30 2007] by Interventional Radiology with successful removal of 80 cc of yellowish fluid .
CONSULTS OBTAINED :
1. Nephrology consults :
**DATE[Feb 29 2007] .
2. Pulmonary consult on **DATE[Feb 29 2007] .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Junctional bradycardia .
Within a few hours of admission , the patient 's heart rate converted to normal sinus rhythm .
The patient continued initially to be bradycardiac .
His heart rate was 40 .
The patient 's bradycardiac persisted after conversion to normal sinus rhythm and so atenolol was discontinued .
However , the patient was overall stable from a cardiac standpoint and the patient was transferred to the General Medicine A-Service care .
While under the care of the General Medicine Service , the patient was transferred to the Medicine Service on approximately **DATE[Feb 19] .
However , under the care of the Medical Service , the patient developed tachypnea , bradycardia , or hypoxia with a new oxygen requirement of 5 liters nasal cannula .
The patient had not been on oxygen at all prior to this time .
Initial chest x-rays did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary edema .
There was concern for pulmonary embolism but a CT study with contrast could not be pursued , as the patient had a significant elevation of creatinine .
The patient 's creatinine initially on arrival to the hospital was 5.2 and at the time of his oxygen requirements , his creatinine was still in the 2.5 to 2.7 range .
The Medicine Service pursued an evaluation via Doppler studies which did not reveal any evidence of thromboses .
The patient also had a VQ scan that was low probability for a pulmonary embolism .
His EKG did not show any acute ST or T - wave changes .
The troponin were checked which showed an elevation of 1.49 on **DATE[Feb 25 2007] .
His troponin earlier in admission when the patient was initially admitted were negative times 3 on **DATE[Feb 18] .
The General Medicine Service subsequently consulted the Cardiologist who evaluated the patient and felt that he should return to the care of the Cardiac Pavilion Service .
Meanwhile , the patient had been treated with heparin drip for presumptive PE treatment and this was continued to for three to four days after his VQ scan did not show PE .
This was being done as clear etiology for his shortness of breath which is still not elicited .
The patient had transthoracic echocardiogram done on **DATE[Feb 26] which showed some wall motion abnormalities but ejection fraction was only mildly decreased at 45 to 50% .
There was moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension as well .
The patient was also showing peripheral edema on exam and the volume was thought to be a contributor to his symptoms .
Several chest x-rays to this point has still not shown any interstitial edema but on **DATE[Feb 28] , chest x-ray did begin to pulmonary edema and by this point , pulmonary embolism had been ruled out .
The patient was receiving diuretic therapy at smaller levels of Lasix at approximately 20 mg IV twice daily .
His creatinine was elevated in the high 2.5 to 2.8 range , so initially these doses were used carefully .
There was some verbal report from someone who had reviewed records at the **INSTITUTION that there maybe some possible interstitial lung disease history in the patient and therefore the Pulmonary Service was also consulted for their input , as the primary lung disorder being the etiology of the patient 's dyspnea .
However , further review did not show any sort of evidence of work-up or reason the patient should have interstitial lung disease .
This could not be further evaluated because the patient was very , very orthopneic that he could not tolerate a CT scan by laying flat .
The patient 's was also seen by the Nephrology Service around that time who recommended more aggressive diuresis .
The patient 's diuretic regimen was quickly escalated to 80 mg q. 8 hours .
In addition , the Pulmonary Service noted that he had moderate pleural effusions bilaterally on his chest x-ray and recommended therapeutic thoracentesis .
A therapeutic thoracentesis was done from approximately 100 cc of fluid .
No pigtail catheter was placed .
This was done on the left side under Interventional Radiology guidance .
Meanwhile , the patient 's urine output significantly increased with the diuresis and his orthopnea improved .
The patient 's O2 requirements began to decrease .
He was at 5 liters of oxygen for approximately one weeks duration , but the patient 's diuretics eventually assisted in his overall symptomatic relief .
Eventually , the patient was no longer on any sort of supplemental oxygen and his orthopnea resolved as well .
Overall , the patient 's symptoms were felt to be due to CHF exacerbation , as the patient was believed to have diastolic dysfunction .
He has a history of MR as well and hypertension which maybe playing a role in this .
Coronary disease :
Once the patient began to stabilize from the heart failure exacerbation , furthers cardiac testing was pursued since the patient had a troponin elevation earlier .
An adenosine myocardial perfusion nuclear thallium stress study was performed .
This was highly suggestive of three - vessel coronary artery disease .
The patient 's creatinine at this time had leveled off in the 3.0 range and though there was a risk that the patient may suffer increased kidney injury from dye exposure , it was felt that the patient 's benefits outweigh the risks and that cardiac catheterization should be pursued .
It was explained to the patient that risks and benefits of the catheterization and the need for him to be on dialysis as a result .
However , the patient did agree to further work - up , as he may have significant underlying coronary disease that would otherwise go undiagnosed .
The cardiac catheterization was performed on **DATE[Mar 05] , that revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease .
The patient had a mid 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery just after take off of a moderate sized diagonal branch .
She had a left circumflex out of proximal subtotal occlusion and the RCA also had a mid 70 to 80% stenosis .
See full cath report for further details , but see the recommendations at that point , we can pursue coronary artery bypass graft surgery .
The attending physician , Dr. **NAME[PPP] spoke to the VA hospital Administrators , as well as , VA Telemetry attending , Dr. **NAME[OOO] and the VA hospital agreed to accept the patient for further care of his coronary artery disease and referral evaluation for coronary artery bypass graft surgery .
Acute kidney injury :
ON chronic kidney disease .
The patient presented initially with a creatinine of 5.2 on **DATE[Feb 18] by **DATE[Feb 23] , his creatinine had come down to 2.5 and is felt to be pre - renal in origin .
Subsequently however , the patient 's creatinine again began to climb , as the patient developed the dyspnea symptoms and his creatinine peaked again to a level of 3.5 on **DATE[Feb 31] .
The patient was seen by the Nephrology Service on **DATE[Feb 29] , who followed very closely as the patient was showing evidence of advanced kidney injury and possible need for further renal replacement therapy .
However , they recommended radiographic diuresis and with such treatment , the patient 's excessive fluid was removed and his creatinine levels subsequently stabilized .
AT the time of this dictation and for the last four days , the patient 's creatinine has leveled off at 3.0 .
In addition , the patient was placed on Aranesp for __________ that maybe related to the chronic kidney disease , as well as , supplemental oral bicarbonate .
It was 650 mg t.i.d. but on transfer orders this was being placed at b.i.d. since the patient 's bicarb has been slightly elevated at 29 .
The patient 's creatinine continues to be monitored as the patient has recently had a cardiac catheterization and ultimately the patient should have outpatient follow up with a Nephrologist due to his advance chronic kidney disease .
Anemia .
The patient 's hemoglobin on presentation was 11.1 .
This did bottom out a level of 7.6 on **DATE[Feb 31] .
Around this time , the patient had been on heparin empirically for PE treatment and the drop occurred during that course .
The patient 's stool did have heme positive results on it on **DATE[Feb 29] , but there was no gross blood seen .
The patient did receive 2 units of packed red blood cells for transfusion and off the heparin , the hemoglobin did stabilize .
Hypertension :
The patient 's blood pressure medications were adjusted during the hospital stay .
Initially , the patient had been on Norvasc .
However , with the edema , the patient 's Norvasc was titrated to off .
In addition his hydralazine was titrated up as well as the patient 's beta blockade .
On **DATE[Mar 05] , 32007 , the patient 's beta blockade was increased to 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
He still is hypertensive and will likely need better blood pressure control .
There is still room to go up on the patient 's clonidine and also add back calcium channel blocker if need be .
