HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old female with a history of MI in **DATE[Dec 2006] who presented to the emergency department yesterday with complaints of left shoulder and neck pain .
She had a small area of left - sided chest pain .
The patient reported that the pain began the day prior to admission following a verbal argument with her grandson .
She denies any trauma .
She did note some shortness of breath initially which subsequently resolved .
However , her shoulder , neck , and left - sided chest pain did persist .
As the symptoms were similar to the symptoms she experienced when she had her MI , she was concerned and decided to come to the emergency department .
She did have a negative troponin at presentation but was admitted to rule out MI .
The patient 's hospital course was essentially unremarkable .
She had recently undergone a heart catheterization in **DATE[Dec 2006] which showed vasospasm .
Additionally , she has had a TTE back in **DATE[Jan 2007] which showed an ejection fraction of 55% and an adenosine stress test in **DATE[Feb 2007] which showed a resting perfusion abnormality at the apex and inferior wall and septum consistent with an old infarct in the mid LAD .
In the hospital on this admission , the patient had a second troponin which was negative .
She tolerated a regular diet and was up and out of bed .
Based on the patient 's exam and her normal troponins , we were confident that her symptoms were much more likely to be related to a musculoskeletal type injury rather than something cardiac .
She did have a shoulder x-ray which was negative .
She will be discharged to home and will follow up with her PCP .
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION :
To home .
FOLLOWUP :
Followup in 1 weeks with Dr. **NAME[VVV UUU] at 94 **INSTITUTION .
