I saw the patient on round with the ICU Team .
I interviewed and examined the patient .
I reviewed his data on EMTEK including vital signs , I 's and O 's , laboratory data , and medication list .
I discussed the management plan with the Critical Care Team after reviewing the House Staff note .
The patient is a **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male with a history of severe gallstone pancreatitis with abdominal abscess formation and also with SMA aneurysm status post repair with PTFE graft with ongoing respiratory failure .
Overnight , the patient had some hypertension and it appeared that tube feeds were being drained from his G tube .
These are tube feeds going through the patient 's J tube .
The patient is afebrile .
Heart rate in the 80 's , his mean arterial pressure in the 90 's to 110 .
His pressure went as high as 190/88 .
He is on assist control ventilation breathing with the ventilator at 20 , tidal volume of 450 , 50% FiO2 and PEEP of 5 .
I 's and O 's 3.1 liters in and 2.9 liters out .
His urine output was 1 liter .
His NG drained 450 mL and it does appear to have tube feeds in the drainage .
He is on Oxepa tube feeds at 40 mL / hour .
Laboratory data is significant for a sodium of 133 , potassium 3.4 .
His BUN and creatinine are 24 and 0.9 .
His white blood count is 4.9 , hemoglobin is 9.7 and it was 10.2 the previous day , platelets are unchanged at 152 .
His magnesium is low at 1.1 .
His INR is 1.4 .
His total bilirubin is 1.6 .
His chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates and edema , but overall slightly improved .
The patient is sedated and denies pain .
He can answer simple questions .
He has some rhonchi bilaterally .
Abdomen is distended and soft .
His wound where the skin is left open and packed is clean .
His PTC drainage is bilious .
From a respiratory standpoint , I am going to decrease the patient 's set ventilatory rate to 10 and wean his FiO2 as tolerated down to 40% .
If he is breathing over the ventilator and maintaining good minute ventilation , we will try CPAP pressure support trials .
In order to do this , I am going to decrease his Fentanyl infusion from 200 to 100 mcg / hour .
The patient is on a heparin drip at 900 units / hour which we are maintaining at this level for his
SMA aneurysm per Vascular Surgery .
From a cardiovascular standpoint , also because of his hypertension , I am going to increase his Lopressor .
We may need to add a second agent for blood pressure control .
He is also receiving p.r.n. labetalol .
From a GI / nutrition standpoint , the patient had evacuation of abdominal abscesses related to his severe pancreatitis with drains in place .
I am going to check an abdominal x-ray .
The patient is being fed through the J port of his GJ tube , but it appears that tube feeds are coming out of the G tube .
I am going to check the x-ray for tube position .
I am going to drop his tube feeds down to 20 mL / hour .
The patient 's electrolytes are being repleted .
He is on linezolid and meropenem day 5 for his pancreatitis - related abdominal abscesses .
He is on his home medications of olanzapine for bipolar disorder as well as Remeron and Wellbutrin .
I am continuing his Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .
