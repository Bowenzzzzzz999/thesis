I personally manage Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the ICU .
An **AGE[in 80s]- year - old man with a history of dementia , aspiration pneumonia , ARDS , and respiratory failure .
The patient continues with ARDS , respiratory failure with a chest x-ray which is compatible with ARDS .
He has not shown any substantial improvement .
He continues to also show poor cardiac perfusion and poor peripheral perfusion .
For the last two days , we have tried to optimize this as best we can and we have not been able to effectively make much difference .
He continues to be on high Fi02 and PEEP .
Ultimately we had a discussion with family and the family has decided to extubate the patient and make him comfortable with morphine .
There does not appear to be anything else reasonably that we can do at this point .
The patient is a comfort measures .
CRITICAL CARE TIME 30 MINUTES .
