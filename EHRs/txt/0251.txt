Mrs. **NAME[AAA] is a very pleasant **AGE[in 40s]- year - old African American lady who works at **INSTITUTION , she apparently did not go to again .
The night that she came to the ER , she was having chest pain on and off all day .
When she came to the emergency room , she was found to have significant ST elevation inferiorly and anterolaterally .
I was called to see her around 2 o 'clock and I came in to see her .
I was concerned about an acute coronary syndrome .
Her first troponins were negative .
We took her to the catheterization laboratory where she had a totally occluded diagonal .
I was preparing to do an angioplasty .
In the usual fashion , I was placing a guide catheter in the left main coronary artery .
I injected some nitroglycerin and took another picture , and the diagonal dramatically opened up .
The tombstone ST elevation in the inferolateral and anterolateral leads dramatically came down , and this patient 's chest pain dramatically subsided .
I watched **NAME[BBB] in the catheterization laboratory for about 15 to 20 minutes , and I kept looking at this artery , and it stayed opened .
At that point , I did not see any plaque or any lesion that required dilatation or angioplasty , so I ended the procedure .
I did a ventriculogram that showed segmental wall motion abnormality at the distal diaphragmatic wall with an EF of about 50% .
End - diastolic pressure was high , but a suspected risk due to the acute spasm would come down .
I placed this patient on the floor .
She did have a very mild pain in her right groin .
Clinically , she did not have a hematoma ; although , she complained of some pain there .
We have given her some narcotics for that time , but it is now better , and she is going to go home this morning .
She understands that she cannot smoke .
She needs to diet , exercise , and lose weight .
I explained to her that she had intense coronary spasm .
I did do a tox screen to rule out cocaine abuse , and there was no cocaine on board .
There were some narcotics on board , but we had given her morphine in the emergency room ; so , I am not surprised about that .
I am not exactly sure what the etiology of his coronary spasm is , but it is clearly coronary spasm when you look at the films , one of the most dramatic cases I have seen in my 20 years of practice .
This patient has a CPK of over 3000 , but her vessel was now open .
She has not developed any Q waves on her electrocardiogram , although she does have nonspecific ST-T abnormalities .
She is going to go home on a combination of Cardizem and nitrates .
I have given her beta blocker because of tachycardia and hypertension as well .
She is going to remain on her Depakote and remain on her Effexor .
I did order a lipid profile that is pending at this time .
I will probably want to treat her with cholesterol - lowering medicines , but I will make that decision on an outpatient basis .
This patient understands that she needs to take a week off .
She will see me in the office .
I will get an echocardiogram and a stress test ; and hopefully , clear her for going back to work in a week or two .
Finally , this patient complained on the day of discharge about burning on urination .
We did not put a Foley into her during her catheterization or during her hospital stay .
However , I did send off the urine and C and S , and I did empirically place her on Bactrim .
I will follow that up in my office as well .
This patient understands that should she have any chest pain , shortness of breath , or other medical problems , she should call immediately .
CONDITION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE :
Stable .
