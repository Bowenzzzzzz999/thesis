DATE OF ADMISSION :
**DATE[Oct 12 2007]
DATE OF DISCHARGE :
**DATE[Oct 16 2007]
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Intermittent atrial fibrillation .
2. Hepatocellular carcinoma .
3. Diabetes .
4. Valvular heart disease .
5. Congestive heart failure .
6. Thrombocytopenia .
7. Hypertension .
8. Anemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an unfortunate **AGE[in 70s]- year - old white male with past medical history of cirrhosis , hepatocellular CA , coronary artery disease , atrial fibrillation , chronic renal insufficiency , thrombocytopenia , anemia , aortic stenosis , and peptic ulcer disease who had one of many recurrent admissions to **INSTITUTION secondary to multiple falls .
He also is having intermittent confusion .
He was found to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was admitted for further management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] has had multiple hospitalizations recently secondary to his multiple complex medical problems .
He has been recommended to have placement on multiple occasions and that the family has not wanted to do so .
He has intermittent episodes of confusion at home and has had recurrent falls .
He was admitted at this time with atrial flutter .
He was unable to be anticoagulated secondary to thrombocytopenia and high bleeding risk secondary to his gastric varices , which he has had multiple banding procedures done .
He was seen in consultation with cardiology and initially was continued on metoprolol and Cardizem was added .
He has some significant bradycardia with this and so the beta blocker was discontinued and his rate fluctuated between 60 and 90 on Cardizem 120 a day .
He was felt that he did not require pacemaker and was a candidate for a pacemaker secondary to his significant medical problems .
He also was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] , the patient 's regular gastroenterologist .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] 's recent MRI s show reoccurrence of the previous ablated area of his hepatocellular CA .
He had evidence of macrovascular involvement in terms of invasion of his portal vein , which make him not a candidate for the potential of a transplant .
In addition , the patient has pretty severe valvular heart disease and is not a candidate for a valve replacement surgery secondary to his liver cancer .
He also has diabetes , which is intermittently controlled and when he goes home he does not check his sugars .
His wife sometimes also gives his medications including Xanax and other medications , which causes him intermittent episodes of delirium .
While in the hospital , the patient was stabilized .
Atrial flutter issues are discussed as above .
His sugars were well controlled and his glipizide was titrated up to 10 mg b.i.d.
Additionally , his lower extremity edema was fairly well controlled and TED hose were added on the day of discharge .
[_______________]*** episodes of bleeding .
His blood count on the day of discharge was stable with hemoglobin of 10.2 , which is near his baseline .
He has chronically low WBC count and his white blood cell count was 3 on discharge and platelets were 45 , which is near his baseline .
His creatinine was 1.7 .
He does have baseline renal insufficiency .
His creatinine was high as 2.4 during his hospitalization , but had stabilized .
After multiple discussions with the family , it was again recommended that he would be placed for at least short term secondary to risk of falls and his overall deconditioning .
The family was in agreement at this time for pacemaker at the **INSTITUTION .
His code status was adjusted during his hospitalization , where he is for chemical code basically only secondary to the poor prognosis of his diseased state .
He certainly is at very high risk for variceal bleed .
It was most likely will be his biggest problem , but is currently has no evidence of any active bleeding .
He has a very significant fall risk and so therefore anticoagulation is not a consideration especially with his low platelet count .
He is to receive physical therapy and occupational therapy with his long - term placement , issues are not currently decided .
He needs to be monitored closely for episodes of CHF and to wear TED hose at all times secondary to his chronic lower extremity edema .
Additionally , he was on potassium supplementation .
His potassium ranged from 5.3 to 3.6 during his hospitalization and stated he should have BMP monitored routinely .
He is not being discharged on any potassium medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His medications on discharge are
1. Vicodin 500/5 1 q.6 h. p.r.n. on use of this medication the patient gets delirious with it .
He has had large left flank hematoma , for which he was using it , but that has been significantly decreased .
2. Additionally Celexa 20 mg a day .
3. Cardizem CD 120 mg a day .
4. Ferrous sulfate 325 daily .
5. Lasix 80 mg tablet daily .
6. Glipizide 10 mg b.i.d.
7. Sliding scale insulin .
8. Protonix 40 mg b.i.d.
9. Xifaxan 200 mg t.i.d.
10. Spironolactone 50 mg b.i.d.
11. Carafate 1 g tablet by mouth a.c. and nightly .
He is to wear TED hose at all time .
He has an occasional urinary retention and can have postvoid residual or straight catheterization p.r.n.
He will be discharged in 2 L of O2 .
Again he should have BMP and CBC on **DATE[Oct 18 2007] in a weekly basis .
He should have followup with Dr. **NAME[VVV] , his gastroenterologist in **DATE[Nov 2007] and Dr. **NAME[UUU] , his cardiologist in **DATE[Nov 2007] .
His code status is as above .
I spent an hour in terms of family discussion , discharge planning , and coordination of care for this patient for discharge to nursing home .
