I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who is status post sternectomy for sternal wound infection .
Her hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure , fluid overload , and hyperglycemia .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the critical care house staff .
Problems and the management are as follows :
1. Respiratory Failure :
A chest x-ray shows an increase in the bilateral effusions .
On the vent , I have her on assist control .
Today I have switched her from AC to pressure support and after a couple of hours of pressure support of 10 , she is a little dyspneic , her heart rate is up , and she has some retractions .
I suspect that her altered sternal mechanics , debilitation , and fluid overload are rate limiting factors for weaning at this point .
I have placed her back on high level pressure support .
Respiratory rate has come down to the range of 12 to 14 .
Tidal volumes are back up and her retractions have resolved .
2. Sternal Wound Infection :
She is going to the operating room tomorrow .
In the meanwhile , I have empirically on cefepime and vancomycin .
Her vancomycin trough is 37 today and I have held her dose with a plan to recheck tomorrow .
3. ICU Prophylaxis :
She is being tube fed at her goal rate .
I have her on a bowel regime .
I have discontinued her IV fluid .
I have her on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control .
The total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
