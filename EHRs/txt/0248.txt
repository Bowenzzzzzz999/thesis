I am currently seeing this **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman on 8D , where a Condition was called secondary to seizures .
The patient has a past medical history significant for normal-pressure hydrocephalus , dementia and coronary artery disease status post CABG in the past .
Upon initial evaluation , after responding to the code on 8D , the patient was having seizure activity .
I did obtain IV access peripherally .
I gave the patient 2 mg of Ativan .
The seizure broke , but then again he had another seizure for which he did get another 2 mg of Ativan .
He continued to seize , and at that point I thought it was probably reasonable to go ahead and get his airway protected .
He again seized and got propofol for this and subsequently the patient did vomit and clearly aspirated .
Intubation was performed and of note the patient did aspirate .
He was bagged with 10 of PEEP and sats did come up to 100% .
Hemodynamically , initially he was a little bit hypotensive .
____________ and the blood pressure did respond to this .
In light of his seizures , I did transport the patient down to CT Scan , for a CT scan of his head , and then transferred the patient to the NICU for further management .
Assessment :
Seizure activity , rule out increased ICP and hydrocephalus .
The patient is going for a CT scan of his head .
He has aspiration pneumonia as well .
Critical care time = 35 minutes .
