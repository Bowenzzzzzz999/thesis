DISCHARGE DATE :
**DATE[Dec 29 2007]
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Paroxysmal events of unclear etiology , rule out seizures .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old male with no significant past medical history who presented to an outside hospital Emergency Department with a second episode consisting of right sided paresthesias that began in the upper extremity and spread through the torso into the lower extremity concomitant with palpitations and a subjective olfactory sensation of smelling rubbing alcohol .
These events were not associated with an abnormality of consciousness , a loss of consciousness or an altered mental status .
There was no adventitious motor activity .
The patient did describe anxiety feelings during these episodes and did have diaphoresis .
At the outside facility presumptively Mr. **NAME[AAA] 's urine toxicology was positive for cocaine .
At the outside facility as well the EKG showed a sinus rhythm .
A head CT without contrast was normal .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was subsequently transferred to the Inpatient Neurology Ward Service at **INSTITUTION Hospital for further evaluation .
This evaluation consisted of laboratory studies , which showed a basically normal basic metabolic panel and troponins that were negative serially x 2 .
AP and lateral view of the chest was unremarkable .
Urine toxicology screen confirmed cocaine metabolites in the urine .
The patient also underwent MR scanning of the brain including diffusion and perfusion with his imaging as well as epilepsy protocol imaging , which was unremarkable .
There was no restrictive diffusion .
There was no abnormal parenchymal signal .
There were no masses identified .
There was no abnormal enhancement .
MR angiography of the anterior and extracranial vessels was non-revealing and unremarkable .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] also underwent electroencephalogram of the brain , which is currently not finalized ; however , was without epileptiform , lateralizing or localizing features .
During hospitalization , Mr. **NAME[AAA] remained neurologically intact and without deficits .
He had no recurrent episodes as previously described but did have 1 episode of palpitations and anxiety with a sinus tachycardia to approximately 100 beats per minute that reverted spontaneously .
This was not associated with paresthesias or abnormal sensorium .
We had a long discussion about the differential diagnosis with Mr. **NAME[AAA] including simple partial seizures , anxiety attacks , anxiety possibly related to cocaine use or atypical migraines .
Since the etiologies of these events are unclear and they are not associated with an abnormal sensorium or an alteration of consciousness , we have elected to gather further data prior to initiating anti - epileptic medications if at all .
We have instructed Mr. **NAME[AAA] at length that he should contact our clinic if he has any further episodes and if these episodes progress or change in symptomatology and certainly if they include an alteration of consciousness or abnormal motor activity that he should present emergently to the Emergency Department .
We also have instructed him that should he have palpitations , lightheadedness , diaphoresis , chest pain , shortness of breath , etc. , he should present to the Emergency Department immediately as well .
We will be obtaining a 24 - hour Holter monitor on discharge as well as setting Mr. **NAME[AAA] up for a prolonged ambulatory EEG in an attempt to capture these spells .
Therefore , Mr. **NAME[AAA] will be discharged home with follow up as noted below on **DATE[Dec 29 07] without complications .
