Other Studies :
MRI / MRA 1/17 :
SMALL VESSEL DISEASE CHANGES ARE SEEN ALONG WITH SOME PROMINENCE OF THE VENTRICULAR SYSTEM .
MR ANGIOGRAM INTRACRANIAL VESSELS :
FINDINGS :
3-D time - of - flight sequences of the intracranial vessels were obtained .
There is some minimal vessel irregularity of most intracranial branches in particular , the posterior cerebral arteries .
No major vessel cut off or occlusion is identified .
No suggestion of intracranial aneurysm is seen .
Mild irregularity , probably representing minor atheromatous disease is seen in the carotid siphon bilaterally .
The distal vertebral arteries and basilar artery are unremarkable .
IMPRESSION :
MILD INTRACRANIAL ATHEROMATOUS CHANGES ARE NOTED .
Impression and Plan
Impression

B-12 level 372 .
Neurosurgery consulted ( 7897 ) to evaluate for trial of CSF removal and their impression of compression . Recommended NPH evaluation with lumbar drain trial .
