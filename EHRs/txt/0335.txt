Briefly , this is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman who had undergone previous lumbar laminectomy by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Aug 18]th .
He had done quite well , however , presented to the office last week with some superficial redness of his wound and a minimal amount of serous drainage .
The patient was given prophylactic antibiotics for this and sent home , at which time he stated over the weekend he had a drop of what he felt was pus on his dressing and was subsequently readmitted in the hospital for reevaluation of possible superficial wound infection .
He was subsequently admitted and due to poor IV access required placement of PICC line and started on both Cipro as well as vancomycin prophylactic antibiotics for suspected superficial wound infection .
He underwent an MRI , which showed a small collection in the wound , and he was scheduled for possible wound debridement .
However , following further evaluation of his wound on **DATE[Aug 29]th , he is noted to have no further redness of his wound and a previous rash has now dissipated .
There is no drainage of his wound , as well , and his staples have been removed .
Throughout this time he has had no fever or chills , and his white count has remained normal at 7.0 .
His sedimentation rate was slightly elevated at 30 .
The patient , per Infectious Disease Service , will be recommended the following antibiotics :
Zyvox 600 mg b.i.d. and Cipro 500 mg b.i.d. for an additional 10 days .
He is also recommended to have weekly CBC and platelet count and instructed to watch for any wound drainage , swelling , or pus , any chills or fever , any other symptoms with increasing pain and to immediately contact the office or go to the local Emergency Room .
The patient is agreeable and he can be discharged home later today following removal of PICC line .
