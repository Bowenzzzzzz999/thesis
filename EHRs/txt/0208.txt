PERTINENT CONSULTATIONS :

The patient is a **AGE[in 30s]- year - old Caucasian female who was admitted to the CCU on account of excessive abdominal pain .
The patient has a previous history of cervical cancer , for which she had surgery and radiotherapy at **INSTITUTION .
On this admission , she had a CT done , which showed that she had a presacral mass , which was also present on the previous CT in **DATE[Oct] .
The mass , however , seemed to have increased in size , and Dr. **NAME[TTT] was consulted for the mass and for abdominal pain .
She had a CT - guided biopsy of the mass , and this was done today .
Results will need to be followed for continuation of management .
Dr. **NAME[UUU] also saw the patient .
He is an oncologist who thinks the patient might need to be referred back to her previous oncologist .
He also said that if it is cervical cancer , then nothing much will be done in terms of chemotherapy .
She would probably need surgery or radiation therapy .
However , that will be dependent on cytologic findings .
The patient was also treated for a urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin .
She has a history of VRE in the urine ; however , we are still awaiting sensitivity pattern .
WBC , however , is improving .
At presentation , she also had severe hypokalemia with a value of 2.2 .
This has been corrected .
The value this morning was 4.4 .
The plan is to continue her on oral supplements .
We think her source of hypokalemia and hyponatremia is the colostomy which she has .
Overall , she is considered clinically stable to be transferred to a regular floor bed for continuation of management .
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS :
1. Ciprofloxacin .
2. Cymbalta .
3. Potassium chloride .
4. Morphine sulfate .
