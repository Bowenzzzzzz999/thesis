I personally interviewed and examined the patient today .
The patient continues to have significant lower abdominal pain .
It may be slightly better than yesterday , but it is still bothering her a lot .
She had about 4 bowel movements after laxatives .
She does not feel constipated today .
Her shortness of breath is also improved .
She is getting bronchodilators .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , she is alert and oriented .
Her blood pressures are generally low in the 80s to 90s systolic , pulse is stable , she is afebrile .
She is in mild respiratory distress at rest .
Chest ; she has bilateral wheezing mostly expiratory , but a lot better than on admission .
Heart ; regular rhythm .
Abdomen ; she does not have any tenderness .
Extremities ; there is no edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory tests were reviewed and electrolytes and renal function are normal .
Her hemoglobin is further down to 10.8 .
Her white count is normal .
PROBLEMS :
1. Abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Our working diagnosis is that she is having rupture of her abdominal aortic aneurysm .
We have discussed it with her .
She is not interested in surgery and at this time we would provide supportive care .
2. COPD .
Her COPD is better .
She would remain on bronchodilators .
3. Anemia .
She has dropped her blood count by about 3 units of hemoglobin , which is a significant amount of blood loss .
This is most likely in the retroperitoneum .
At this time , we will not plan any transfusions .
