The patient is a very pleasant **AGE[in 80s]- year - old male with a past medical history dyslipidemia , coronary artery disease , hypertension , one episode of atrial fibrillation , and benign prostatic hypertrophy who presented with acute onset of difficulty using his right hand .
He was evaluated in the **INSTITUTION Emergency Department and underwent a CT scan of the brain , which showed a small left prefrontal hematoma .
Subsequently , he underwent an MRI of the brain as well as MR angiography of the head and the neck which showed a left posterior frontal lobe hematoma with a small amount of adjacent associated subarachnoid hemorrhage likely due to amyloid angiopathy however with a possibility of an underlying cavernous angioma .
Otherwise , the MRI of the brain was unremarkable and there was mild atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the right internal carotid artery with an otherwise unremarkable extracranial and intracranial MRA .
The patient was also evaluated by the Neurosurgical Service who did not see any need for intervention secondary to the small size and the minimal dysfunction that the patient had .
The patient subsequently underwent a stroke workup by the Stroke Neurology Team and this was including a transthoracic echocardiogram , which showed a normal left ventricular size and function with normal left ventricular segmental function and an ejection fraction of 55% to 60% .

There was mild left atrial enlargement , and a saline contrast injection was negative for any right - to - left intracardiac shunt .

Laboratorywise , a fasting lipid profile was obtained , which showed a triglyceride level of 81 , total cholesterol of 210 , LDL of 133 , HDL of 64 , and VLDL of 13 .

Hemoglobin A1c was noted to be 5.5 .
During the hospitalization , the patient remained stable .
