Mr. **NAME[AAA] has done reasonably well overnight .
He is complaining of some thirst this morning and would like to eat .
He has had some nausea last night but no vomiting .
On exam , he is afebrile .
His vital signs are stable .
His abdominal distension is decreased .
He is breathing comfortably between 14 and 18 times a minute .
Oxygen saturations are in the mid 90 's on nasal cannula O2 .
Ins and outs are overall net negative after the diuretics that I gave him yesterday .
His laboratory examination is significant for a slight increase in his total bilirubin yesterday to 11 .
Bilirubin today is pending .
The surgeons are arranging for a contrast study through the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube to evaluate his jaundice .
His transaminases are unremarkable , as is his GGT and alkaline phosphatase .
Right upper quadrant ultrasound does not show any signs of ductal dilatation .
I suspect most likely diagnosis is cholestasis from the surgery but will continue to follow along closely .
He is diuresing nicely with Lasix and still has some vascular congestion on radiographs , as well as edema on exam , and I have given him some more Lasix today .
The patient should be stable for transfer to a monitored surgical bed today .
