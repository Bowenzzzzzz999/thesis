The patient is **AGE[in 80s] years of age .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is an unfortunate individual who has advanced terminal bladder carcinoma with local invasion causing severe obstructive uropathy to both kidneys requiring nephrostomies during his previous admission .
Unfortunately , even given the nephrostomies , the patient 's condition has continued to deteriorate with progressive renal failure and bleeding from the urinary bladder .
He was seen during his course of admissions by his surgeon and his urologist as well as Nephrology ; all felt that there is nothing else that can be done except comfort measures .
Discussions were held with Mr. **NAME[AAA] .
He continues to refuse dialysis which would be his only intervention that would help him survive his progressive renal failure .
Certainly , it would not change the terminal nature of his bladder cancer .
With this in mind , he opted strictly for comfort measures , and we are now referring him to a hospice center .
He will be on minimal medications including Prozac 10 mg q.a.m. , furosemide 40 mg IV b.i.d. , Humulin Regular sliding scale insulins ; isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily ; Synthroid 25 mcg daily ; morphine sulfate 2 mg IV q.2 hours p.r.n. pain , stress , and anxiety; and Protonix 40 mg daily .
Zosyn has been discontinued .
His discharge prognosis obviously is extraordinarily poor .
Comfort measures only .
