I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male , who is status post laparoscopic colectomy for colonic polys .
This in the setting of ischemic heart disease with some moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction as well as hypertension and history of mechanical mitral valve .
His preoperative fluid management has been difficulty and postoperatively he was transferred to the intensive care , intubated , sedated and mechanically ventilated .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient and reviewed his laboratory , radiographic and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the surgeons and Critical Care Team .
The problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure :
Chest x-ray shows a pulmonary artery catheter and endotracheal tube in reasonable position .
He does have some signs of volume overload with pulmonary vascular congestion on the ventilator right now .
His gas exchange is good at 40% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP the current assist control settings .
My plan is to leave him sedated .
He is in a primarily narcotic based sedative regimen over the course of the evening with no plans on ventilatory weaning until after we have a better feel for his hemodynamics .
2. Ischemic heart disease and status post mitral valve repair :
His PA catheter is showing pressures of about 55/30 and I suspect that he has chronic pulmonary hypertension , given these numbers .
Cardiac index is around 2.2 with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of around 58% .
His lactate is less than 2 .
On exam , his toes although not cold and reasonably well - perfused with reasonable distal pulses in the dorsalis pedis and other extremities are reasonably well-perfused as well .
Given the fluid overload on the chest x-ray , the central venous pressure in the mid 20s and the pulmonary hypertension , I have elected to start empiric diuresis this evening while maintaining an adequate cardiac output .
I instructed the bedside nurses to follow cardiac outputs on a q.2 hourly basis with mixed venous oxygen saturations .
I have started him on a Lasix infusion in order to try and get some excess fluid off him after his operation .
3. ICU Prophylaxis :
He has some stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .
I have started him on some glycemic control .
TOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 40 MINUTES .
