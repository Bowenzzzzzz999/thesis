**DATE[Aug 20 07]
I am seeing Mr. **NAME[AAA] for critical care at the request of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , as well as neurosurgery .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] was admitted as a fall .
He was found to have a left subdural hematoma .
He also has a history of seizure disorder and a biomechanical mitral valve replacement in the past .
He has been orally intubated and mechanically ventilated .
He has had failure to recover consciousness until recently .
The family and the nursing staff tells me that he does follow commands today at least with his left thumb , which he raises in response to command .
The patient 's temperature is 37 .
Blood pressure is 120/60 .
Pulse is 60 .
There are both atrial and ventricular pacer spikes , occasionally present , indicating that the patient has apparently a DDD pacemaker .
He is ventilated in the assist control mode at a rate of 14 , 650 ml tidal volume , 40% FiO2 and 5 of PEEP .
On those settings peak inspiratory pressure is in the mid 20s and he has unlabored ventilation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Significant for clear breath sounds bilaterally .
Heart is regular rate and rhythm .
His abdomen is soft , nontender , and not distended .
There are positive bowel sounds .
There is 1 + peripheral edema , and he is receiving SCD s for DVT prophylaxis .
Free Dilantin level is 2.1 .
Potassium is 2.8 .
BUN and creatinine are normal .
Phosphorous is 1.6 .
White blood cell count is normal .
He is tolerating Osmolite 20 ml / h. as well as cefepime day 2 , insulin , Keppra , Pantoprazole , Dilantin , and vancomycin .
EEG was reported as having no seizures .
As the patient has no fever and no white blood cell count and cultures are negative , I am going to discontinue the cefepime and vancomycin .
I am changing the Keppra to p.o. from IV .
I will speak to Neurosurgery and Neurology regarding potentially decreasing the Dilantin dose .
I am going to replace the patient 's phosphate to try to get his phosphate level up into the normal range .
I am going to decrease his IV fluids in an effort to allow him to be fluid negative .
I will continue him on his tube feeds and increase them as tolerated .
To try to augment diuresis , I am going to give the patient some spironolactone .
I am choosing this instead of our usual Lasix because of his persistent hypokalemia .
It is my hope that using this agent I can both affect some diuresis and correct his potassium .
I will do a CPAP trial on the patient , and if he tolerates that well , and if he is able to guard his airway well we can consider extubation sometime in the near future .
However , today his mental status is clearly not adequate to tolerate that .
Total time taken in the care of this critically ill patient is **AGE[in 40s] minutes .
