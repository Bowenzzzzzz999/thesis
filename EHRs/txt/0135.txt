2. PT and OT .
STUDIES COMPLETED :
1. On **DATE[Feb 18 2007] , chest x-ray was normal .
2. On **DATE[Feb 19 2007] , ultrasound of the kidneys , no hydronephrosis or perinephritic collection , mildly increased cortical echogenicity and nonspecific finding of prerenal parenchymal disease .
3. On **DATE[Feb 23 2007] , chest x-ray showed very minimal fluid at the right base .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year - old African American veteran who presented to **INSTITUTION on **DATE[Feb 18 2007] , complaining of a 4 - day history of lightheadedness , nausea , decreased appetite , fatigue , and chest pain .
He has a past medical history of chronic renal insufficiency , hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , CVA , and last echocardiogram showed an EF of 55% in 2003 .
He denied any syncopal episodes , palpitations , shortness of breath , fever , or chills .
He was initially seen in the VA where he was found to be in a junctional rhythm .
His first troponin was negative and then he was sent to **INSTITUTION 's ED .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission showed sodium of 128 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 92 , CO2 19 , BUN 75 , creatinine 5.2 , glucose 105 , and troponin was negative .
White count 12.1 , hemoglobin 11.1 , hematocrit 31.8 , 90% neutrophils , 4% lymphocytes , and BNP 358 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
From a cardiovascular standpoint , he was admitted to a Stepdown Unit and monitored on Telemetry .
Cardiac enzymes were completed and were negative x 3 .
His beta blocker was held .
We asked Cardiology to evaluate his rhythm .
It was their impression that he likely had decreased p.o. intake and with his history of chronic renal failure and being on a thiazide diuretic and beta blocker , he became more dehydrated .
They recommended discontinuing his beta blocker and thiazide all together and placing him on Norvasc .
Once his medications were changed and he was adequately hydrated , he did return to a normal sinus rhythm in the 80 s .
However , his blood pressure became quite high with systolic pressures in the 170 s to 180 s .
He was on a maximum dose of Norvasc , and we added hydralazine q.i.d.
On top of this , we added a clonidine patch of 0.2 mg and then finally achieved blood pressure of less than 140 s .
In regards to his renal failure , it was likely acute on chronic renal insufficiency .
He was hydrated for several days .
His creatinine trended down rapidly , and the day prior to his discharge , it was 2.5 which we believe is his baseline .
Again , we did check a renal ultrasound which was without any significant findings .
In light of his renal insufficiency , we also put him on sodium bicarbonate tablets which brought his CO2 to normal range .
He does live alone and there was concern of his safety for discharge .
He was seen by Physical and Occupational Therapy as well as Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation .
It was of their opinion that he would be safe to be discharged home if he has assistance at home .
He does not need any inpatient rehabilitation .
We will discharge him home with home physical and occupational therapy as well as home nursing to check on his blood pressures and medication understandings .
The day prior to his discharge , he had an isolated temperature of 38.5 .
We checked a chest x-ray and urinalysis which were normal .
We also checked blood cultures which were pending at this time .
The patient denied any subjective feelings of fever , chills , dysuria , cough , and shortness of breath .
Therefore , we will discharge him home and have him follow up with his PCP or return to the ED if he has any more fevers .
