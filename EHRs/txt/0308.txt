ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 12 2008]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Jan 15 08]
I personally interviewed and examined the patient on **DATE[Jan 15 2008] .
I discussed the case with Dr. **NAME[TTT] .
Please consider my note linked to Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's .
Reviewed the patient 's history and physical and hospital course since admission .
The patient has a history of dementia , was living in a nursing home .
He developed a cool left foot and was transferred here for possible ischemic disease .
He was found , however , to have deep venous thrombosis as an explanation for this complaint .
The patient was also found to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and has been evaluated by Cardiology .
His ventricular response has been well controlled with a beta blocker , but he did have an episode of hypotension last night .
The patient is unable to provide any additional history .
He is minimally responsive today ( which appears to be near his baseline ) and does not have any specific complaints .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is arousable but does not answer questions .
Head :
Normocephalic .
Eyes :
PERRLA .
Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion .
Heart :
Regular rhythm .
Abdomen is soft .
Extremities :
He has mottling of the left leg with minimal edema .
His right leg appears normal .
LABORATORY STUDIES :
Include today a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 115 , CO2 28 , BUN 53 , and creatinine 1.3 .
His glucoses have been reasonably well controlled .
Calcium today is 10.6 , magnesium 1.4 , and phosphate 2.2 .
White count today 12,100 .
Hemoglobin 8.8 and hematocrit 25.2 .
His hematocrit on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] , at 4 a.m. was 32.7 ; that was 29 at 6 p.m. on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] , and 7:15 p.m. on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] and as mentioned 25.2 at 3:30 this morning .
His platelet count is 135,000 .
INR is 1.3 .
He is receiving Coumadin hair therapy and heparin .
His PTT today is 65.4 , which is in the therapeutic range .
Blood culture performed on **DATE[Jan 14 2008] , is negative at this time .
The patient is stable , but he does have a modest decrease in his hemoglobin .
We will repeat that later today .
If he does have ongoing bleeding , we may need to consider stopping his anticoagulation and placing an inferior vena cava interruption device .
However , if possible , I will prefer not to do that .
There is no gross evidence of external bleeding or internal bleeding at this time .
We will continue to monitor him for further signs of decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit .
The patient is not a candidate for cardioversion as he appears to be asymptomatic and is already anticoagulated .
This would be another reason to try to keep him on anticoagulant therapy .
