Mr. **NAME[BBB AAA] is a very nice **AGE[in 80s]- year - old white male , right handed , who was admitted to this hospital , **INSTITUTION , transferred from **PLACE with increased wheezing and shortness of breath .
He was found to have lung cancer on CT scan of the chest with a large lung nodule on the left lung as well as a small lung nodule on the right side .
He was taken to the OR on **DATE[Sep 18 2007] , by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] for bronchoscopy , bronchoalveolar lavage , as well as a placement of a right chest tube .
Cytology came back positive for nonsmall cell lung cancer .
The patient was sent to the ICU for couple of days , and he was able to retransfer to the floor .
Today on examination , the patient is awake , alert , and oriented x 3 .
Pupils are equal , round , and reactive to light .
There is no evidence of any neurological deficits .
His temperature is 35.6 , his heart rate is 60 , respiratory rate 20 .
He is saturating at 96% on room air .
His blood pressure is 120/60 mmHg .
His last laboratory workup from yesterday afternoon reveals a sodium of 135 , potassium of 5 with a chloride of 98 , bicarbonate of 23 , creatinine of 2.8 , and BUN of 100 .
He is known to have kidney failure .
White blood cell count from **DATE[Sep 22 2007] , is down to 8000 with a hemoglobin of 11.7 and a hematocrit of 34.9 , and platelet count of 57,000 .
On physical examination , the patient is ventilating adequately on both sides of the thorax with clear entry sounds , perhaps mild wheezing bilaterally .
Cardiac area is rhythmic .
Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended with good peripheral pulses .
The patient is tolerating the diet and the current problem with him is that while attempting to walk and go to the bathroom , he is complaining about dizziness as well as weakness .
I do not feel that the patient is a candidate for rehabilitation since he has not had any acute problems with walking , trauma , major stroke , or any fractures on the lower extremities .
He does have an old fracture about a month ago or so on the right elbow .
This does not preclude the patient from walking .
His family is not able to take care of him right now , so I would recommend short stay in a skilled nursing facility to continue with his current medication regimen as well as insulin and glucose control .
Once the patient recovers a little bit more of strength , he should be able to return back to home .
On today 's x-ray , I do not see any sign of pleural effusion or pneumothorax .
He should continue on his current medications which include
1. Regular insulin with a low - dose sliding scale before meals .
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Combivent 1 or 2 puffs q.2 h. p.r.n.
4. Pepcid 20 mg by mouth twice a day .
5. Tylenol 650 mg by mouth q.8 h. p.r.n.
6. Vicodin 1 tablet p.o. q.6-8 h. p.r.n.
7. Heparin subcutaneous 5000 units twice a day for DVT prophylaxis .
8. Prednisone wean down , he is currently on 15 mg by mouth daily which should be given as 10 mg p.o. in the morning and 5 mg p.o. in the afternoon .
He should be able to be weaned off the prednisone within a couple of days .
Please , decrease by 5 mg every 3 to 4 days .
9. Lasix 40 mg p.o. daily .
Please note that the patient should be seen for followup by Dr. **NAME[YYY ZZZ] in 2 weeks from today and please schedule an appointment with hematology / oncology in his local town , **PLACE .
