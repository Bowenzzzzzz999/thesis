Mr. **NAME[AAA] is without complaints this morning .
On examination his fever curve has come down nicely .
His vital signs are stable .
His heart rate has come down into the 90 's .
His abdomen is soft and nondistended and nontender .
Breath sounds are somewhat diminished at the base with some bronchial breath sounds posteriorly .
Extremities are warm and dry .
Laboratory examination shows BUN and creatinine of 38 and 1.2 today .
Ins and outs were overall net balanced in last 24 hours , 1.5 liters of urine output .
White blood cell count 8000 .
Blood cultures showing gram-positive cocci from a aerobic and anaerobic bottles drawn from the PICC line .
The plan today is to pull his PICC catheter .
I ordered a repeat peripheral blood cultures x 2 .
He remains empirically on Zosyn , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
I suspect the PICC line infection is the most likely site of his fevers and rigors that occurred previously .
I stopped his TPN today when we got the PICC line .
I left him on to D5 normal saline .
He is a stable for transfer to 9G today .
Vascular surgeons should be by sometime this afternoon to write transfer orders .
