HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the regular floor under the care of Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] , and he stabilized the patient .
At Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's request , I assumed care of the patient and continued Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's overall therapy .
We felt that the blood sugar should be better controlled , and we resumed the home dose of glipizide , but we utilized metformin instead of Avandia to avoid the fluid retention and other side effects of the thiazolidinediones .
Also , weight loss hopefully would be a positive event in this morbidly obese patient .
We discontinued the IV fluids but also switched from IV to oral Lasix .
Rocephin 1 gram IV daily was instituted .
The Mefoxin was 850 mg b.i.d.
A PICC line had to be inserted on **DATE[Mar 23 07] , for difficulty maintaining vascular access .
The patient , in general , was very stable and slowly improved .
Her temperature went down nicely .
On **DATE[Mar 26 07] , the patient appeared to be doing very well .
Blood sugar was 208 .
We were able to switch from IV Rocephin to the oral fluoroquinolone agent Cipro in view of the sensitivities .
There was no oral form of Rocephin .
The patient appeared to be doing exceptionally well .
The lungs were clear , the heart was regular , and the extremities had minimal edema .
Vital signs were stable , and she had gastrointestinal and genitourinary function .
We discharged the patient in satisfactory condition , with followup with Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] .
