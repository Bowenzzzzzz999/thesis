The patient was seen and examined by myself .
Laboratory values and chest x-ray film were reviewed by myself .
He remains in the Intensive Care Unit and suffers from the following problems :
1. Respiratory failure - The patient is status post laryngectomy and right neck dissection .
He remains on mechanical ventilation .
We tried to wean him yesterday ; however , he did not tolerate that .
Today , he is doing well on pressure support of 10 .
The plan is to wean that to a tracheostomy mask .
The patient had a significant history of COPD , and I am afraid if we do not get him off the ventilatory quickly , we might have difficulty getting him off the ventilator , so we will be a little more aggressive .
I have already gave the instructions to the respiratory therapist to do so .
2. COPD - The patient is on multiple medication for that including theophylline .
We will continue on that , and we will continue on albuterol and Atrovent .
3. DVT prophylaxis - He is on SCDs and also on heparin .
4. GI prophylaxis - He is receiving Pepcid .
I SPENT A TOTAL OF 32 MINUTES ASSESSING , EVALUATING , AND MANAGING MR. **NAME[AAA] .
