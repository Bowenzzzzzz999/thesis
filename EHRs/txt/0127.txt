HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with right upper extremity arm swelling , patient with a known innominate vein occlusion .

The patient was also seen by the renal service to be given his dialysis treatment .
The patient was currently being dialyzed through a right groin tunneled dialysis catheter .
The patient had a venogram performed on **DATE[May 8 2007] , which showed an occluded right innominate vein .
This was unable to be recanalized .

Over the next couple of days , the patient had an improvement of his swelling almost back down to baseline .

The patient was notified that if the swelling persisted , most likely he would need a fistula ligation versus a venous bypass .
With elevation and heparinization , the patient 's arm swelling decreased .
