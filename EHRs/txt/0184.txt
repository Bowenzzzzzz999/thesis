**DATE[Dec 23 07]
I am managing this critically - ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old gentleman with several complications arising from his severe biliary pancreatitis , the most recent procedure for debridement of a necrotic gallbladder , placement of a PTC catheter , repair of SMA pseudoaneurysm .
He is suffering from ARDS , malnutrition and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the Vascular and General Surgery Team , as well as the Critical Care house staff .
The problems of my management are as follows :
1. Pancreatitis .
The patient is on Oxepa through the J tube and he seems to be tolerating the tube feeds at the moment , and they are also refeeding his PTC drainage back into his tube feeds to prevent excessive biliary losses .
2. Respiratory failure .
The patient was placed yesterday on pressure support ventilation .
He tolerated that fairly well and this morning , his pressure settings are 10/5 and today I will try to switch him to 5/5 with a goal of extubating the patient .
3. Hypertension .
The patient seems to be still resistant to multiple medications for the management of his blood pressure and his systolic blood pressures were as high as 173 ____________ of four hours .
Today , I will increase the doses on Lopressor and captopril before adding a new agent and I am planning to use clonidine as an additive agent if need be .
4. Malnutrition .
The patient is on Oxepa at the moment and still at low serum albumins .
I am planning to continue with his tube feeds started and over a long course , I think he will catch up with his caloric intake and he will build up new protein and muscle bulk .
5. Infectious issues .
The patient is currently on linezolid and meropenem for the positive cultures for Pseudomonas and enterococci and we will follow our course with the antibiotics .
6. ICU prophylaxis .
The patient ___________ prophylaxis with Pepcid and he is on heparin infusion for DVT prophylaxis as well as for the maintenance of the SMA graft and he is on a sliding scale insulin for blood glucose management .
The total critical care time spent was 37 minutes .
