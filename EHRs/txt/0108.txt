I am seeing Mr. **NAME[AAA] for critical care at the request of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] and the General Surgery Service .
Mr. **NAME[AAA] is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old gentleman found down with a small subdural hematoma and in the hospital was found to have some evidence of seizure disorder .
He also has a DDD pacemaker in place .
His temperature is 37.6 , blood pressure 112/55 , pulse is 70 and sinus rhythm .
He also has frequent atrial and ventricular pacing spikes .
He has 40% FiO2 and 100% saturated .
We have been ventilating him in the CPAP mode effectively .
He is awake , he opens his eyes to voice and follows commands briskly .
When I asked him to do a forced vital capacity maneuver , he participated well .
He has a 1.2 liter vital capacity of forceful cough that is effective in clearing secretions .
His heart showed no S3 or murmur .
Lungs were clear and equal bilaterally .
His secretions are mucoid , and decreased compared to yesterday .
Abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
He has trace peripheral edema .
His I 's and O 's are 3.1 liters in and 1.8 liters out for a mildly positive fluid balance of just over a liter .
His potassium is 3.3 , this is in spite of receiving spironolactone for diuretic and potassium replacement .
His magnesium is in normal range but his phosphate is low .
I am going to continue to supplement this patient 's potassium orally / IV .
I am also giving him some potassium phosphate to bump up his phosphate level , as well as his potassium .
I am going to continue him on the spironolactone to try to spare some potassium , but he did have a fluid balance .
I am planning on extubating him and so I gave him a dose of Lasix as well .
I did extubate the patient .
Her has a very nice cough afterwards .
His voice is only slightly horse and he is appropriate .
I have asked Respiratory Therapy to deliver chest PT and assist him with cough .
His free Dilantin level is in the therapeutic range .
He is tolerating Keppra well .
His glucoses are controlled , less than 150 , so no additional medication changes were warranted .
Total time taken in the care of this critically - ill patient was 45 minutes .
