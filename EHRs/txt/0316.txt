I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male status post laparotomy and debridement in the setting of pancreatitis .
Hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure from ARDS .
I am seeing him for management of this and his multiple medical problems .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the surgical team .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory insufficiency .
Chest x-ray continues to show stable bilateral infiltrates .
Last night he was on BiPAP at a setting of 12/8 with FIO2 titrated to maintain oxygen saturations of greater than 94% .
He was unable to tolerate any time off the BiPAP yesterday .
This morning I have taken him off the BiPAP and he has done well on a nonrebreather face mask through most of the day but is becoming somewhat tachypneic later in the afternoon and I plan to place him back on BiPAP at these same settings overnight .
He is diuresing reasonably well and I have discontinued his Lasix drip and changed him to Lasix 40 mg q. 12 hourly in order to keep him overall net negative .
We will watch his BUN and creatinine closely which are at 20 and 0.7 today and his bicarbonate is up to 33 .
2. Hypertension .
I suspect that some of his hypertension is related to the weaning efforts .
He is currently on captopril , Lopressor , and clonidine for that .
3. ICU prophylaxis .
I have discontinued the fentanyl drip as he is not complaining of any pain and started him on some intermittent Dilaudid .
He is on a heparin drip for prophylaxis after his SMA repair .
I have ordered an albumin and prealbumin today to assess his nutritional status and he seems to be tolerating his tube feeds at his current rate .
Total critical care time = 40 minutes .
