I saw the patient on rounds with the Critical Care Team and with the Trauma Team .
I interviewed and examined the patient at the bedside .
I reviewed the house staff note and agree with the findings .
I reviewed the data on EMTEK including vital signs , I&amp ; O , laboratory data , and medication list .
I discussed the management and plan with the Trauma Team and with the Critical Care Team .
The patient is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male who was found down .
He has a history of a seizure disorder .
He also has a pacemaker and is status post mitral valve replacement and has a reported history of significant ethanol use .
There were no events over night .
He has been afebrile .
He has not been tachycardic .
His systolic pressures are from the mid 90s to 120s over 50 to 72 diastolic .
He has been breathing spontaneously and maintaining good oxygen saturations .
Respiratory rate is approximately 20 .
His urine output has been adequate .
He has been tolerating tube feeds with osmolyte 50 ml per hour via an NG tube .
The patient complains of " pins and needles " from the knees down in both lower extremities .
On exam , he is more awake .
His speech is clear .
He is answering questions appropriately .
His smile is symmetric , although at rest while he is lying on his right side , his right lip was drooping .
He is moving all extremities .
His abdomen is soft and nontender .
His extremities are warm .
He has bilateral knee abrasions that are clean .
His white blood count is 2.6 , hemoglobin is 11.3 , platelets are 123 , magnesium is 1.7 , sodium is 141 , potassium is 3.8 , chloride is 105 , bicarbonate is 32 , and BUN and creatinine are 12 and 0.8 .
From a neurologic standpoint , Neurology recommends an EEG .
We will continue his Dilantin and Keppra with his seizure disorder .
From a respiratory standpoint , the patient is responding well to IPPB treatments for respiratory therapy .
He is currently getting them q. 4 hours and we will continue the q. 4 hour IPPB treatments .
We will also increase the patient 's activity , getting him out of bed to assist with his pulmonary status .
I am discontinuing his Aldactone which was started here in the hospital .
I will continue his tube feeds for the time being , however , now that he is more awake we will obtain a swallow evaluation and if he is not deemed a high aspiration risk , we will remove the NG tube and have the patient take his diet by mouth .
Because of the patient 's calf discomfort that he is describing as pins and needles , I am obtaining duplex looking for DVT ; however , my suspicion is that this is neuropathic type pain .
He does have good pulses ; however , this may be related to microvascular disease or possibly related to ethanol use .
I am giving him three days of multivitamins , thiamine , and folic acid treatment empirically .
The patient is stable for transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit to a monitored floor .
