Medical management :
**AGE[in 80s] yo female with a significant PMH for severe DJD that presented to the ED with severe pain in the left hip .
She had been having troubles with the right hip secondary to her DJD but the left hip had never really bother her .
2 days before admission she started to complain of a minimal complain in the left hip but it was very tolerable so she decided to control this with the same medication she was taking for the right hip pain .
The medication did not help and for the last 12 h the pain had been excruciating so she decided to come to the ED .
She described the pain as an excruciating pain **DATE[Sep 11] , sharp that does not radiate and worst when in motion .
Also her concerned was that her pain was always in the right hip but not in the left .
She denied any fall .
At home she was controlling her pain with tramadol , but not very succesfully .
When admitted x rays were done in ED and no fracture was obvious , we decided to control the pain with oxycodone , that controlled the pain very well but made the patient a bit confuse .
Also she became agitated during her hospitalization probably secondary to being in the hospital , acute distress of the pain and pain medications .
It was neccesary to put her on restraints fro couple of hours but after this she was no agitated so there were taken off and she did not require any more , she recieved risperidone 0.25 PO that seemed to work very well .
Being the pain under controlled now , we will send her to SNF for rehab and also is not safe at home for her given her bilateral hip pain .
