I am managing this critically - ill **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male who is status post laparoscopic colon infection in the setting of severe ischemic heart disease with a cardiomyopathy status post mitral valve replacement and pulmonary hypertension .
I am seeing him for management of his respiratory insufficiency , ischemic cardiomyopathy , pulmonary hypertension , and fluid overload .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiograph intake data , and discussed the management with the general surgeons .
The problems and their management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure :
A chest x-ray shows pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral effusions in the tracheal tube and pulmonary artery catheter in good position .
The PA pressures are in the 45-60 range over 20s .
Today , I have discontinued his propofol drip , cut his fentanyl drip in half , and after a two hour pressure support have been able to wean and extubate him .
Subsequently , I have discontinued his fentanyl completely and left him on intermittent doses of narcotics for pain control .
He will need to stay in the intensive care unit for pulmonary toileting .
2. Ischemic heart disease :
**PLACE , PA pressures have been relatively high , but stable over the course of the evening after extubation .
His PA pressures have increased with PA systolics in the 70s and 80s and central venous pressures around 8 .
His heart rate is gone from the 70s to the 90s .
Cardiac output has increased as well and is currently about 7.5 liters with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 74% .
Given the fact that he appears to maintain adequate forward flow despite the elevation in his pulmonary artery pressures , I have decided to gradually diurese him over the course the day .
I have left him on a Lasix drip , which I am titrating up in order to make sure he remains overall net negative .
I have started some gentle beta blockade in light of his adequate cardiac output as well and we will try to get his heart rate down today .
Currently , he remains off heparin , but will need to be reanticoagulated shortly in light of his decreased left ventricular function and his mitral valve .
Total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
