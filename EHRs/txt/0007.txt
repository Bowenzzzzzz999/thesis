He had a GI evaluation with Dr. **NAME[TTT] who consulted the hepatologist Dr. **NAME[SSS RRR] at **PHONE regarding Mr. **NAME[AAA] .
He was thought to be a candidate for steroid therapy and Trental .
Steroids are a double-edged sword , however , and we need to be vigilant regarding infection control and with this patient 's glucose control as he is diabetic .
Dr. **NAME[RRR] will be happy to follow the patient at **INSTITUTION .
Other recommendations are the patient will have a paracentesis with cell count , C and S , and total protein which has been done , 2.5 L was removed from the patient .
The fluid removed was yellow clear in color .
There were 139 WBC s , there were 99 RBC s , 1 neutrophil , 2 lymphs , 48 monos , and 37 mesothelial cells , 12 macrophages .
The fluid albumin was 0.6 and total protein of 0.7 .
He had a urine C and S which was detailed as above .
The culture is currently no growth times 2 days .
A nasal swab , which has been done .
The patient will be ready for insulin therapy if needed during his course of steroids .
He will need q.i.d. glucose monitoring , sliding scale , and close follow up with PCP or endocrine .
A diabetic educator has been consulted for patient , they have instructed the patient .
He does have two monitors at home and he says old glucometer strips .

He will start prednisone 40 mg per day x 4 weeks , then 1 week rapid taper as outlined by Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's note .

We would like to see that the patient is at least willing to follow up with Dr. **NAME[UUU] before starting prednisone therapy .
He will be discharged on Trental 400 mg t.i.d.
Since the patient 's total protein in the ascites was less than 1 we will start him on Cipro 750 mg p.o. weekly x 4 weeks for his [_______________]*** prophylaxis .
His weekly labs will include a CBC , LFT s , PT , INR , lytes , BUN , creatinine , and glucose .
He should have a physician visit weekly without fail between his PCP Dr. **NAME[UUU] and the hepatologist Dr. **NAME[RRR] .
If his WBC count increases on steroids he should have a blood culture , urine C and S every week .
The patient has a 50% mortality risk the next month .
We have instructed the patient the importance of alcohol cessation .
He is adamant against acute inpatient rehabilitation .
He has had this in the past and has not worked and he is very much against outpatient rehabilitation , although , he is now willing to consider it after we have spoken to the patient at length .
We have instructed that he follow up with Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
