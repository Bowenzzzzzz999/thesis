REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old female who was seen in the office because of shortness of breath .
She was unable to go from room to room .
This has been progressive over the past month but no chest pain .
She also had a severe cough with scanty sputum production .
She is an ex - smoker .
Only other history is abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
The patient has been on albuterol , Fosamax , aspirin , Cardizem , Zetia , and Zocor at home .
On arrival , chest x-ray showed a new left pleural effusion since that of **DATE[Mar 22 2007] , with an inflammatory versus neoplastic disease to be considered .
She was , therefore , admitted with a lung lesion to rule out carcinoma and for pulmonary evaluation .
LABORATORY DATA :
Initial sodium 138 , potassium 3.6 .
BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.0 .
Troponin 0.06 .
Glucose 120 .
Hemoglobin and hematocrit 9.8 and 29.3 and white count 14,000 .
BNP is 15 .
Troponin levels were negative .
At discharge , at one point , potassium was 3.3 , which was repleted .
Bronchial washings :
No Legionella was isolated .
Echocardiogram :
Concentric LVH with an ejection fraction of 60% , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , and mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension .
Cardiogram :
Sinus tachycardia .
As outlined above , the patient was admitted because of an abnormal chest x-ray suspicious for carcinoma of the lung .
Dr. **NAME[VVV] was asked to see the patient .
He read chest x-ray showing right pleural effusion and possibility of a developing neoplasm .
He did recommend bronchodilators .
O2 saturations were followed , and he also recommended an immediate bronchoscopy , as CAT scan showed a large left lower lobe 9 x 5.5 cm mass with decreased attenuation and infiltrate adjacent to the mass .
There were pulmonary nodules varying from 1 to 5 cm and extensive mediastinal left hilar enlarged subcarinal adenopathy .
Bronchoscopy was performed .
The left lower lobe bronchus showed some narrowing .
The preliminary cytology was that of a nonsmall - cell lung carcinoma .
For this reason , Dr. **NAME[UUU] was asked to see the patient from oncology standpoint , and he felt that the patient had at least stage III lung cancer and agreed it could be nonsmall cell .
The patient and husband were informed that this was not an operative situation and that palliative treatment was the best option either in the form of chemotherapy or radiation therapy .
He did recommend an outpatient PET scan for staging and to follow within 10 to 14 days at his office .
During this admission , the patient also developed a rectal bleed and was seen by Dr. **NAME[TTT] who recommended a colonoscopy .
When electrolytes were corrected , colonoscopy was carried out on **DATE[Nov 17 2007] , showing a long loopy colon with hemorrhoids .
He recommended Anusol suppositories along with Citracal .
Potassium had been low and was corrected .
To complete with workup , an echocardiogram had also been done because of left pleural effusion .
Results are as above .
From standpoint of lung carcinoma , final pathology was that of a nonsmall - cell carcinoma .
Arrangements were made for the patient to have a PET scan as an outpatient and continued followup with Dr. **NAME[UUU] .
She was free of chest pains and shortness of breath at this time .
She will follow a regular diet .
No heavy lifting over 10 pounds .
Her PCP , Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] , will see her within 2 weeks , Dr. **NAME[VVV] as directed , and Dr. **NAME[UUU] within 10 to 14 days .
Electrolytes , BUN , and creatinine will be done on **DATE[Nov 25 2007] .
Home care nurses will also follow as needed .
At this time , the patient is free of symptoms , but will report any fever over 101 or hemoptysis or increase in sputum production .
