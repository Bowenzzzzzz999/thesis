ATTENDING PHYSICIAN :
**NAME[WWW M. XXX] , M.D.
ADMISSION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 04 2007]
EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Mar 05 07]
I saw the patient on rounds with the trauma team .
I interviewed and examined the patient at the bedside .
I reviewed the house staff note .
I agree with the findings .
I discussed the management plan with the trauma team and with the patient .
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old female admitted yesterday with abdominal pain .
She reported had tripped over her dog and fell on steps , landing on her left side on **DATE[Feb 21 2007] and has been having some abdominal pain .
She also has a history of pancreatitis in the past of unclear etiology .
At **INSTITUTION she was found to have significant splenic injury and was transferred here for further evaluation and management yesterday .
The patient states that she had some p.o. intake this morning and feels somewhat bloated .
Her abdominal pain , however , is unchanged .
She is afebrile .
Her vital signs are stable .
Her sclerae are clear .
Her chest is clear anteriorly .
Her abdomen is soft .
She does have left - sided tenderness with voluntary guarding , no involuntary guarding .
Her extremities are symmetric , warm , and well perfused .
Neurologic is nonfocal .
Her hemoglobin and hematocrit that we have been checking have been relatively stable with no significant drop .
Her creatinine yesterday was 0.8 .
I looked at the CT scan from **INSTITUTION that was done on **DATE[Mar 04 2007] and there is evidence of splenic laceration with subcapsular hematoma about a grade 3 injury .
There is no free blood in the pelvis .
No other obvious injuries to my read .
She has her splenectomy vaccines ordered .
We are getting the patient out of bed with assistance today , and we will let her have diet as tolerated .
We will continue to follow her hemoglobin and hematocrit somewhat less frequently about every 12 hours that she has remained stable and this has delayed diagnosis .
I am going to check an amylase and lipase tomorrow and I am also going to obtain a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast tomorrow to evaluate for any progression or evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation .
I have discussed this with the patient .
