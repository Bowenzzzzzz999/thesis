ADMISSION DATE :

EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Apr 27 07]
I am personally managing the care of Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He is receiving mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure .
I have examined the patient on rounds with the House staff .
I have reviewed the patient 's data and radiographs .
Events in the last 24 hours include temperature spike with significant hypotension requiring resuscitation with crystalloid and administration of stress dose corticosteroids .
IMPRESSION :
This is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male with a past medical history for double lung transplantation in **DATE[Jan] of 2006 , for emphysema , who presented on **DATE[Apr 12] , with dyspnea .
His course has been significant for transbronchial biopsies that first revealed no acute cellular rejection. He had empiric antibiotics and then had no growth in his bronchoalveolar lavage .
He required noninvasive ventilation with BiPAP , eventually having hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation .
One transbronchial subsequent biopsy showed evidence suggestive of diffuse alveolar damage .
He remains on mechanical ventilation currently .
KEY ISSUES :
1. Acute respiratory failure :
He is receiving mechanical ventilation - mode is PRVC FIO2 45% , respiratory rate 26 over a rate of 26 with a tidal volume of 430 cubic centimeters .
He has no significant compliance issues .
He actually tolerated some pressure support of 5 yesterday with adequate tidal volumes .
I am concerned since his CT scan of the chest obtained last night shows worsening air space disease .
2. Lung transplantation :
I am currently concerned about rejection versus pneumonia .
He is receiving empiric antibiotics consisting of cefepime and vancomycin .
We will obtain a bronchoalveolar lavage today , to rule out ventilator - associated pneumonia or opportunistic infection .
He has significant pulmonary hypertension and his recent transbronchial biopsy was complicated by significant bleeding .
We have asked our Lung Transplantation surgeons to consider open lung biopsy .
I feel if his alveolar lavage is unremarkable , we should obtain one , in an effort to find rejection that would require high - dose immunosuppression .
3. Adrenal insufficiency :
He had some hypotension .
I have placed him on hydrocortisone 100 milligrams intravenous every 6 .
4. Moderate mitral regurgitation :
His is on afterload reduction with hydralazine .
He is also receiving nitrates .
5. Immunosuppression :
He is currently receiving tacrolimus 0.5 milligrams twice a day .
His goal is 12 to 15 .
His tacrolimus trough today is pending .
6. Infectious prophylaxis :
He is receiving voriconazole 200 milligrams twice a day .
We have held his valacyclovir yesterday because of leukopenia .
He also is receiving Bactrim prophylaxis .
7. Chronic renal insufficiency with acute renal failure :
His urine output is adequate today with 625 cubic centimeters .
Yesterday , he had 3.4 Liters of urine , and his BUN and creatinine has stabilized 79/1.6 .
He is receiving enteric feeds .
Critical Care time spend exclusive of teaching and procedures provided throughout the day is 85 minutes .
