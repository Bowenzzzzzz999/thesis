The patient continued to use IV Dilaudid around the clock and after all of the above testing came back normal , I had a long conversation with the patient and he was made aware of the fact that he needs to address his depression and anxiety problems with regular followup with a psychiatrist , and the Dilaudid was tapered and discontinued within 48 hours .
