I am managing this critically ill **AGE[in 40s]- year - old gentleman with several complications arising from his severe biliary pancreatitis with a most recent procedure for debridement of a necrotic gallbladder , placement of a PTC catheter , repair of SMA pseudoaneurysm .
He is also suffering from ARDS , malnutrition and gastrointestinal tract dysfunction .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the Vascular and General Surgery Team , as well as the Critical Care house staff .
The problems and management are as follows :
1. Gallstone pancreatitis .
The patient was started on Oxepa through the J tube , and he seems to be tolerating tube feeds at the moment , and they are also refeeding his PTC drainage back into his tube feeds to prevent excessive biliary losses .
2. Respiratory failure .
The patient is recovering from his ARDS , and we are planning to switch him to pressure supported ventilation today .
3. Hypertension .
The patient is currently on Captopril and Lopressor for his blood pressure management .
His recent blood pressures from the arterial line were up to 180 mmHg systolic with a diastolic around 100 ; so , today we will increase the doses on the Captopril as well as on the Lopressor before adding a new agent .
4. Malnutrition .
The patient has been started on Oxepa , and he still has low serum albumin levels , as expected , and we are planning to continue with G tube feeds as tolerated , and this will be a slow progress .
5. Infectious problems and sepsis .
On blood cultures from **DATE[Dec 11 2007] , the patient had Pseudomonas and enterococci , and he is currently on linezolid and meropenem for the management of infectious process in his blood as well as is his abdomen .
6. GI prophylaxis .
The patient is on GI prophylaxis with Pepcid .
He is on heparin drip for his SMA graft as well as for DVT prophylaxis , and he has additionally SCDs .
He is on a sliding - scale insulin for blood glucose management .
THE TOTAL TIME SPENT ON THIS PATIENT WAS 33 MINUTES .
