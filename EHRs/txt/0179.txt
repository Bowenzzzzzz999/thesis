No pleural effusion .
2. On **DATE[May 18 2007] , CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showing slight decrease in lingular nodules since **DATE[May 19 2006] , stable to decreasing hypodense hepatic foci at least a portion of which may be scarring , no evidence of active inflammatory process or significant ascites .
3. On **DATE[May 19 2007] , bronchoscopy with BAL .
HISTORY :
The patient is a **AGE[in 20s]- year - old white male who presented to **INSTITUTION 's ED on **DATE[May 17 2007] , complaining of several - day history of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting as well as generalized malaise .
He has a past medical history of chronic granulomatous disease , recurrent Aspergillus pneumonia , liver abscess with Staphylococcus aureus , and recent discharge with the diagnosis of possible fungal pneumonia .
In the ED , he denied fever , chills , melena , chest pain , palpitations , and myalgias .
He had been off his prophylactic Bactrim for approximately a week when he was discharged from a week ago , he was instructed to go to the bronch lab and get a BAL .
Unfortunately when he called to make this appointment , they had no record of him .
Laboratory data showed a sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 105 , CO2 24 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1 , and glucose 77 .
White count 8.9 , hemoglobin 12 , hematocrit 37 , platelet count 295 , 85 neutrophils , 12 lymphocytes , 2 monocytes , lipase 177 , total bilirubin 1 , ALT 36 , AST 76 , alkaline phosphatase 87 , and GGTP 32 .
Incidentally , we did consult General Surgery , as there was a concern that he may have an acute abdomen .
We did evaluate the patient following his CT scan and did serial exams , and they felt that he did not have any acute surgical issues .
In regards to his abdominal pain , our differential diagnosis was broad at first .
We thought that he could very well still be constipated versus viral bacterial gastroenteritis versus appendicitis or worsening of his liver abscess .
Although clinically , he did not appear to be septic , overnight on his first hospital night , he developed a fever of 40.1 with severe chills and rigors .
At this point , we consulted Infectious Disease .
We did pan culture him with blood cultures , urine cultures , stool cultures , and eventually a bronchoscopy with BAL .
At this point in time clinically , he did not appear well , and he was started on IV vancomycin and Unasyn as well as continuing his itraconazole .
We did check a CT scan of his chest , abdomen , and pelvis , and as mentioned above , it only showed a modestly improved hepatic abscess .
None of his cultures grew out either .
Over the course of the next 24 to 48 hours clinically , he improved dramatically .
He was afebrile , feeling much better and had an appetite .
His white blood cell count did come down as well .
With this chronic granulomatous disease , it is difficult to analyze his blood work , as he may not have leukocytosis .
The final recommendations from Infectious Disease are to complete a total of a 2 - week course of IV vancomycin and Unasyn IV .
Once that is completed , he should start on oral cefadroxil and rifampin .
All the while , he should continue with his Bactrim and itraconazole .
Furthermore , we will schedule him for repeat CT scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis and then see Dr. **NAME[PPP] in Infectious Disease in approximately 4 weeks .
From a pulmonary standpoint , again he had been off his Bactrim so he could have a BAL to evaluate a pulmonary nodule as well as his pneumonias .
Pulmonary Medicine was consulted and did complete a bronchoscopy with BAL .
At the time of this dictation , his cultures have all been negative .
They were quite adamant that he did not have any clinical symptoms suggestive of pneumonia .
We did obtain an abdominal x-ray on the patient that did show severe constipation , but no obstruction .
He was not having bowel movements with Colace and Senokot .
Therefore , we did try mag citrate for several days per the recommendation of General Surgery .
He then started to have loose stools .
We have instructed him at home to eat a high - fiber diet with fruits and vegetables as well as taking in water .
We will instruct him to use Colace and Senokot as needed for constipation in the future .
Again the stool cultures we did receive back on **DATE[May 18 2007] , were negative for Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter , C. difficile , and white blood cells .
Overall , the patient has been doing much better .
He has been afebrile , hemodynamically stable and overall feeling better .
He does have an appetite .
