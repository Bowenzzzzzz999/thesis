I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male who is postoperative day #4 from repair of SMA pseudoaneurysm .
Postoperative course complicated by fluid overload , respiratory insufficiency and jaundice .
I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the General and Vascular surgeons .
PROBLEMS AND MANAGEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS :
1. Respiratory failure .
Chest x-ray shows increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and infiltrates .
On the vent , I have him on assist control .
His peak airway pressures , minute ventilation and gas exchange have been adequate .
I did place him on a pressure support trial today and after a two-hour trial , his rapid shallow breathing index was less than 100 .
I have weaned and extubated him .
I have also given him a couple doses of Lasix today which he has responded with a brisk diuresis .
Clinically he is improving with the diuresis and will continue to diurese him over the course of the evening .
2. Status post SMA aneurysm repair .
He remains on prophylactic antibiotics .
I have increased his dose of labetalol for better blood pressure and heart rate control and he seems to be responding nicely to that .
His abdominal distention has improved significantly as has his tenderness .
I will start some trickle tube feeds with Peptinex today .
Of note , his total bilirubin is up to 10 today .
His transaminases are unremarkable .
Previously , his bilirubin was around 5 to 6 .
I suspect that he just has some increasing cholestasis after the surgery .
We have ordered a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate .
Total Critical Care time = 40 minutes .
