EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Nov 12 07]
I was asked to some see this **AGE[in 80s]- year - old patient over in Geriatrics and **INSTITUTION admitted for depression and ECT therapy .
She has a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and COPD .
I was called to evaluate her secondary to worsening respiratory distress .
Apparently , according to history , she started to complain of being shortness of breath , increased work of breathing around 02:00 a.m. this morning .
This apparently worsened over the course of the last few hours .
When I initially saw her , she was hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the 170s .
She was tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 30s , as well as tachycardic with a heart rate in the 120s .
She was use accessory muscles working fairly hard to breathe and had diffuse coarse rhonchi throughout .
In light of this , gave her 20 mg of Lasix .
She also got several treatments of Xopenex which appeared to offer some relief .
My concern as well was the fact that she had been oxygenating quite well on 5 liters of O2 , and when I evaluated her O2 sat , 5 liters , was only 83% .
So , did put her on a nonbreather mask .
Sats came up to 95 , 96% .
In light of this , I thought it was probably reasonable to go ahead and transfer her to the MICU Service as opposed to a monitored floor service in light of her oxygen requirements and her worsening respiratory status .
There is some concern whether or not she could have aspirated during her ETC therapy which is possibility , could be just exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia .
She does have a history of being recently treated for pneumonia back in **DATE[Feb] of this year .
Hemodynamically , she has remained stable .
She is mentating , a little confused and very cantankerous .
So , at this point in time , I did transfer her to the MICU for further management .
Otherwise continue her current supportive care and management as per the MICU Service .
Critical care time = 31 minutes .
