EVALUATION DATE :
**DATE[Feb 31 07]
I am managing this critically - ill , **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female , who is status post external debridement for a sternitis post CABG , hospital course now complicated by fluid overload and respiratory failure .
I am seeing her for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed her laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data , and discussed the management with the critical care house staff .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. MEDIASTINITIS .
Her vancomycin trough level today is 23 .
I have repeated the dose of vancomycin and will watch the levels closely for the next couple of days .
I have left her on her cefepime ; current dose is 2 grams q. 12 hours .
White blood cell count is up to 23,000 today .
Platelets are up to 93,000 .
She is going to the operating room tomorrow for another debridement .
2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE .
Chest x-ray shows some decrease in the bilateral effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion .
I have rested her overnight on a pressure support of 20 .
She has been comfortable with this , with tidal volumes of around 500 to 700 and a respiratory rate of around 9 to 12 .
Today , we have done a brief partial support trial at 5 , and she became tachypneic with a high rapid shallow breathing index .
I have rested her back on full support .
I suppose that she will need longer term mechanical ventilatory support until her pulmonary mechanics have improved .
3. ICU PROPHYLAXIS .
I have KVOd her IV fluid , increased her tube feeds to 45 mL an hour , and increased her beta blockade in light of her ischemic heart disease .
The total critical care time equals 40 minutes .
