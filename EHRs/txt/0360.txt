I am managing this critically ill , **AGE[in 40s]- year - old male , who is recovering from pancreatitis .
His course has been complicated by an SMA aneurysm , status post repair , as well as an infected phlegmon , status post debridement , with ARDS and subsequent respiratory insufficiency. I am seeing him for management of these issues .
I have seen and examined the patient , reviewed his laboratory , radiographic , and EMTEK data and discussed the management with the general surgeons .
Problems and management are as follows :
1. Respiratory failure :
Chest x-ray today shows some decrease in his bilateral infiltrates .
Last night I rested him on BiPAP .
This morning he has done much better off the BiPAP with comfortable respiratory rate between 18 and 24 breaths per minute , oxygen saturations in the mid - 90s on the 6 liter oximyzer .
I would like to try and to keep him off BiPAP tonight if possible .
He is starting to developed a little bit of the decubitus of the bridge of his nose .
I have asked Wound Care to come by and see that .
2. Pancreatitis :
The abdomen is soft , he is tolerating his tube feeds at his goal rate and clinically he seems to be improving .
His white blood cell count is 4.9 and he has been afebrile .
He remains on Meropenem as well as linezolid for treatment of his infection .
3. ICU prophylaxis :
He is being tube fed at his goal rate .
His albumin level was 2.1 today , prealbumin is still pending .
His glycemic control has been adequate .
He is on Heparin dose for his SMA repair , but he has had some bleeding from the lower aspect of the wound .
If he continues to bleed , I will be obligated to turn off the Heparin , at this point .
He is a little bit dry intervascularly and I have decreased his Lasix dose .
He continues to diurese nicely .
