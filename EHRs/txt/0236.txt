MRI / MRA 1/17 :
SMALL VESSEL DISEASE CHANGES ARE SEEN ALONG WITH SOME PROMINENCE OF THE VENTRICULAR SYSTEM .
MR ANGIOGRAM INTRACRANIAL VESSELS :

3-D time - of - flight sequences of the intracranial vessels were obtained .
There is some minimal vessel irregularity of most intracranial branches in particular , the posterior cerebral arteries .
No major vessel cut off or occlusion is identified .
No suggestion of intracranial aneurysm is seen .
Mild irregularity , probably representing minor atheromatous disease is seen in the carotid siphon bilaterally .
