I personally interviewed and examined the patient today .
The patient is complaining of continued abdominal pain generally at lower abdomen and mid lower abdomen .
The pain appears to be somewhat worse today .
Her shortness of breath is about the same or better .
She is still coughing .
She denies any dizziness or lightheadedness .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Overnight , her blood pressure went down as low as 60 systolic .
Her heart rate was also elevated .
She was afebrile .
Her mental status remained normal .
She was given fluid volume bolus with blood pressures coming up into the 80s and 90s .
She is in no acute distress this morning .
Her chest exam is the same with some wheezes .
Heart is regular .
Abdomen , there is no tenderness or masses .
Aneurysm size is about 6 cm on my examination today .
Extremities :
There is no edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Her electrolytes are normal as well as renal function today .
Her hemoglobin though is decreased to 10.9 from 13.9 .
This was repeated and the repeat number is the same .
PROBLEMS
1. Abdominal pain .
We are concerned about leakage of aortic aneurysm .
We will get a STAT CT scan today .
I am particularly concerned about it because her hemoglobin has dropped as well and she was hypotensive overnight .
She was given fluids .
2. COPD .
She is getting nebulizers and will continue those .
She appears to be stable regarding respiratory status .
3. Anemia .
The etiology of anemia is not quite clear .
She has no GI bleeding and in fact is constipated .
We will check CT scan of the abdomen , and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin and hematocrit .
