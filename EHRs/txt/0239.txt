Multiple cholelithiasis , prostate enlargement , moderately large right inguinal hernia containing nonobstructed bowel loops , and bilateral small multiple diaphragmatic intrathoracic pleural calcifications .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is an **AGE[in 80s]- year - old gentleman who was admitted to the **INSTITUTION through the emergency room when he was brought there complaining of generalized weakness , excessive swelling of the lower extremities , and some abdominal discomfort of minimal degree .
The patient has a history of bipolar disorder , depression , prostatic hypertrophy , and chronic anemia .
He was evaluated and was placed on diuretics ; subsequently , the venous Doppler studies did confirm DVT affecting the left lower extremity .
The patient was placed on subcutaneous Lovenox .
He also was treated with elevation of the feet .
On **DATE[Mar 4 2007] , he became confused , disoriented , hypotensive , and was transferred to CVU .
His hemoglobin did drop significantly also and a transfusion was undertaken .
A subsequent CT scan did confirm retroperitoneal hematoma .
He was evaluated by vascular surgery service , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , and pulmonary service was also consulted .
The surgical service , Dr. **NAME[WWW] , was consulted .
The patient was monitored closely in the intensive care unit , where hemoglobin and hematocrit were closely monitored and transfusions were given to maintain hemoglobin around 10 grams .
He had abdominal pain relieved with morphine .
He had no reversible obstructive bowel process ; however , he gradually did improve although he was noted to have a left pleural effusion which was tapped and was noted to be hemorrhagic .
A thoracic surgical consultation was asked from Dr. **NAME[VVV] and he thought that no surgical intervention was necessary at this point .
The patient was also not very keen to undergo any such surgical intervention .
His respiratory status remained fairly stable and he did gradually improve .
His abdominal pain subsided .
He was able to tolerate some liquids .
His hemoglobin and hematocrit also remained stable .
He was transferred to TCU for continued monitoring and care in stable condition .
