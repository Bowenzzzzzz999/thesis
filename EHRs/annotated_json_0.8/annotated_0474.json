REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :\nGranrivern Call is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .\nHis family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .\nThis was poorly responsive to Eldopa .\nHe was later seen by Dr. Flo Cuchkote at the Ph University Of Medical Center and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .\nOver the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .\nHe also developed a urinary incontinence .\nHe had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .\nOn the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .\nHe was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.\nThere was no definite clonic activity .\nThere was no known incontinence .\nHe was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the Ph University Of Medical Center Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .\nA trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nCoumadin 4 mgs po qhs , Vasotec 5 mgs po qd , Lasix prn , Digoxin 0.25 mgs poqd , Proscar and Sinemet .\nALLERGIES :\nno known drug allergies .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n1) atrial fibrillation on coumadin ,\n2) deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus ; the wife states since he was in the infantry in World War II .\n3) Question progressive supranuclear palsy .\n4) old right frontal infarct .\n5) hypertension .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nHe lives with his wife who is his primary care giver .\nHe is a former professor at Montana .\nTobacco ; he has some distant history of some very minimal use .\nAlcohol ; he has no recent use .\nHe was a previous drinker of one &quot; old fashioned &quot; every night .\nFAMILY HISTORY :\nHe has a father who had dementia .\nThere was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nvital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .\nHe was afebrile .\nIn general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .\nhead , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination ; abrasions about his forehead , there was some minimal swelling associated .\nHis neck was rigid ; 1+ carotids without bruits .\noropharynx was intubated with blood as well .\nLungs ; clear to auscultation bilaterally .\nCardiovascular examination ; regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\nAbdominal examination ; soft , non-tender , non-distended , normal active bowel sounds .\nExtremities :\nno clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .\nNeurologically ; he opens his eyes to voice .\nHe does not regard the examiner .\nHe had no blink to threat .\nHis pupils were three down to two on the right and five down to four on the left .\nAccording to the family this iansicoria was old .\nHe had intact corneals bilaterally and intact horizontal dull movements bilaterally .\nHe had left greater than right nasal stimulation to grimace .\nHe had no gag to tube manipulation .\nMotor examination he had a weak withdrawal to nail bed pressure in both hands .\nHe triple flexed his bilateral lower extremities to pain .\nHis deep tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right brachial radialis and right patella ; everywhere else his reflexes were 1 .\nHis toes were down going .\nSUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :\nsodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .\nchest x-ray clear .\nelectrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .\nHead CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .\nThere was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n1) NEUROLOGY :\nThe patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .\nHe had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .\nIt did , however , show diffuse slowing .\nHe was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .\nHis hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .\nHe continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .\nHe did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .\nHis diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .\nIt was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .\nIt was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .\nHe had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .\nThis showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .\nIn addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .\nHowever , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .\nThe etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\nHis electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .\nHe was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .\nHe did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .\nThat was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .\nHe remained chest pain free throughout his admission .\n3) PULMONARY :\nAfter his initial intubation he remained quite stable .\nHe was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .\nHowever , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .\n4) HEMATOLOGY :\nHe had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .\nHis anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .\nIt was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .\nHe did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .\nIt was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .\n5) GASTROINTESTINAL :\nHe was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .\nThus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .\nIn discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .\nHowever , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .\nThe family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\nStable .\nDOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nThe patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Ria in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nDilantin 100 mgs po tid ,

CT](303653007&408754009) scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal [hemorrhage](50960005&131148009) with minimal surrounding [edema](267038008&79654002) .\nThere was also evidence of an old right frontal [infarction](55641003) .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n1) NEUROLOGY :\nThe patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .\nHe [had an electroencephalogram](54550000) performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of [seizure](91175000) activity .\nIt did , however , show diffuse slowing .\nHe was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on [examination](302199004) .\nHis [hypertension](38341003) ; his [high blood pressure](38341003) was controlled with intravenous [nitroglycerine](387404004&71759000) in the early going and then he was switched to an [oral](738956005) regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .\nHe continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his [ability to move](301998005&301438001) .\nHe did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more [awake](248218005) and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .\nHis [diagnosis](439401001) of [progressive supranuclear palsy](192976002&28978003) was placed under question on further [examination of his eye](36228007) movement since he was [able](371150009) to have excellent superior [gaze](246772007) especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with [progressive supranuclear palsy](192976002&28978003) .\nIt was felt that his dementing [illness](39104002) and [rigidity](16046003) was most [likely](2931005) due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia [degeneration](33359002&278313005) process , but this was not clarified during this admission .\nIt was not felt [likely](2931005) to be due to Parkinson &apos;s [disease](64572001) , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of [tremor](26079004) , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .\nHe [had an magnetic resonance imaging](113091000&312250003) performed on October 18 , 1996 .\nThis showed the [unchanged](260388006) left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal [hematoma](35566002&385494008) and the old embolic right frontal [infarct](55641003) , but there were no new [lesions](52988006&49755003) and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with [amylase](387031005&713358006&116534006) [angiopathy](27550009) .\nIn addition , he gadolinium scan did not show [enhancement](418393006) at the area of his [hemorrhage](50960005&131148009) , so [tumor](108369006) was felt to be unlikely .\nHowever , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the [hematoma](35566002&385494008) is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying [tumor](108369006) or arterial [venous malformation](234124003) that could be currently compressed by the area of [hemorrhage](50960005&131148009) .\nThe etiology of his bleed was felt to be most [likely](2931005) secondary to [hypertension](38341003) , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\nHis [electrocardiogram](29303009) was concerning for [ischemia](52674009) .\nHe was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-[coagulation](119266004) .\nHe did have a slight [elevation](103720008) of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .\nThat was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .\nHe remained [chest pain](29857009) free throughout his admission .\n3) [PULMONARY](738985004) :\nAfter his initial [intubation](52765003) he remained quite stable .\nHe was found to be at a large [aspiration risk](371736008) given his decreased [mental status](36456004) and the lack of [presence](386397008) of a [gag reflex](33485004) .\nHowever , he was given aggressive [pulmonary](738985004) [toilets](53303003) including chest physical [therapy](276239002&277132007) [and aspiration precautions](386519006) and the patient did not develop any [pulmonary](738985004) symptoms during his admission .\n4) HEMATOLOGY :\nHe had his [prothrombin](7348004) time reversed with [Vitamin K](69169004&22606007&63136007&66656000&126238009&422073002&714619003) 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .\nHis anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his [history](392521001) of [deep venous thrombosis](128053003) and [pulmonary](738985004) [embolus](55584005) as well as [atrial fibrillation](49436004) , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .\nIt was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .\nHe did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on [heparin](372877000&84812008) intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of [heparin](372877000&84812008) at that time .\nIt was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further [problems](55607006) .\n5) GASTROINTESTINAL :\nHe was evaluated by the speech and [swallow](288937009) pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was [able to
