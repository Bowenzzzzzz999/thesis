:\n1-9-94\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nMediastinal tumor mass .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\nHistory of colon cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , obesity , hypertension , history of myocardial infarction .\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\nJanuary 3 , 1994 , median sternotomy with mediastinal exploration , radical resection of tumor and aortopulmonary window ; partial resection of adjacent lung , en bloc resection of vagus and phrenic nerves ; partial pericardectomy ; fiberoptic bronchoscopy .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .\nThe patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .\nIn December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke &apos;s grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .\nShe received postoperative chemotherapy .\nIn September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .\nThe exploratory laparotomy was negative .\nShe continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .\nIn September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .\nIn December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .\nShe also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .\nShe also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nThe patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\nThe past surgical history is notable for a 1971 mastectomy on the right , 1937 appendectomy , 1991 cholecystectomy , 1992 transverse colectomy , 1992 exploratory laparotomy , 1991 bilateral cataract surgery .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nLevoxine 0.125 mg PO q.day , Vasotec 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Maxzide 75/50 , 30 mg PO q.day .\nALLERGIES :\nThe patient is allergic to sulfa .\nHABITS :\n50 pack year smoking history , still smoking currently .\nEthanol :\nnone .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination , she is an obese white female in no acute distress with a hoarse voice .\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination shows that she is normocephalic , atraumatic , extra ocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the oropharynx was clear , neck was supple without lymphadenopathy , either axillary or supraclavicular .\nChest is clear with decreased breath sounds at the left base .\nShe has a previous right mastectomy .\nCardiovascular exam :\nregular rate and rhythm , without murmur , rub or gallop .\nAbdomen :\nobese with multiple well healed surgical incisions , positive bowel sounds .\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative without masses .\nExtremities :\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nThe neurological examination is nonfocal .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .\nThis mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .\nThe frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .\nShe had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .\nThis tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .\nThis additional chest tube was removed the following day .\nHer postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .\nHer postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .\nMediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six .\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nPercocet for pain .\nFollow up with Dr. Fede Duhenile .\nShe will have a home health aide to visit and help her with meals .\nCA SHUFF
