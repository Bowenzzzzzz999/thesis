Respiratory failure :\nChest x-ray shows a pulmonary artery catheter and endotracheal tube in reasonable position .\nHe does have some signs of volume overload with pulmonary vascular congestion on the ventilator right now .\nHis gas exchange is good at 40% FIO2 and 5 of PEEP the current assist control settings .\nMy plan is to leave him sedated .\nHe is in a primarily narcotic based sedative regimen over the course of the evening with no plans on ventilatory weaning until after we have a better feel for his hemodynamics .\n2. Ischemic heart disease and status post mitral valve repair :\nHis PA catheter is showing pressures of about 55/30 and I suspect that he has chronic pulmonary hypertension , given these numbers .\nCardiac index is around 2.2 with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of around 58% .\nHis lactate is less than 2 .\nOn exam , his toes although not cold and reasonably well - perfused with reasonable distal pulses in the dorsalis pedis and other extremities are reasonably well-perfused as well .\nGiven the fluid overload on the chest x-ray , the central venous pressure in the mid 20s and the pulmonary hypertension , I have elected to start empiric diuresis this evening while maintaining an adequate cardiac output .\nI instructed the bedside nurses to follow cardiac outputs on a q.2 hourly basis with mixed venous oxygen saturations .\nI have started him on a Lasix infusion in order to try and get some excess fluid off him after his operation .\n3. ICU Prophylaxis :\nHe has some stress ulcer and DVT prophylaxis .\nI have started him on some glycemic control .\nTOTAL CRITICAL CARE TIME EQUALS 40 MINUTES .\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW M.
