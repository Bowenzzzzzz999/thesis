PO q.d.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nBreunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .\nShe is referred for progressive angina .\nShe had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .\nShe has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .\nIn 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .\nIn October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .\nShe had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .\nIn 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .\nShe had exertional angina at that time .\nIn November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .\nShe had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .\nSince that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .\nShe was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .\nBecause these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .\nIn May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .\nShe had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .\nShe has had no syncope .\nHer cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .\nShe has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .\nShe is a remote cigarette smoker .\nShe also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .\nShe has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nShe is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci\nShe lives alone .\nHer son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .\nThey live in Ohio .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nShe is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .\nHer blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .\nNeck veins are not distended .\nRespiratory rate 12 .\nCarotids :\nno bruits .\nLungs were clear .\nCardiac :\n1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\nAbdomen was benign .\nPeripheral pulses intact .\nNeurological examination non-focal .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .\nHematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .\nSodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .\nThere , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .\nHer left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .\nShe had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .\nHer native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .\nThe saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .\nThe left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .\nThe saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .\nThis was considered her culprit lesion .\nThis was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .\nIn addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .\nHer left internal mammary artery was also unused .\nIt was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .\nShe would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .\nThis was intermittent .\nThe P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .\nThe patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .\nIt was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .\nHer pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .\nShe was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .\nWhen her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .\nCarotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .\nHe felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .\nFor this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .\nThe situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .\nOn August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .\nThere was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .\nIt just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .\nShe tolerated this well .\nHer medications were resumed .\nShe ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .\nACHASTHA N.
