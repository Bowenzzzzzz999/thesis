He had empiric antibiotics and then had no growth in his bronchoalveolar lavage .\nHe required noninvasive ventilation with BiPAP , eventually having hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation .\nOne transbronchial subsequent biopsy showed evidence suggestive of diffuse alveolar damage .\nHe remains on mechanical ventilation currently .\nKEY ISSUES :\n1. Acute respiratory failure :\nHe is receiving mechanical ventilation - mode is PRVC FIO2 45% , respiratory rate 26 over a rate of 26 with a tidal volume of 430 cubic centimeters .\nHe has no significant compliance issues .\nHe actually tolerated some pressure support of 5 yesterday with adequate tidal volumes .\nI am concerned since his CT scan of the chest obtained last night shows worsening air space disease .\n2. Lung transplantation :\nI am currently concerned about rejection versus pneumonia .\nHe is receiving empiric antibiotics consisting of cefepime and vancomycin .\nWe will obtain a bronchoalveolar lavage today , to rule out ventilator - associated pneumonia or opportunistic infection .\nHe has significant pulmonary hypertension and his recent transbronchial biopsy was complicated by significant bleeding .\nWe have asked our Lung Transplantation surgeons to consider open lung biopsy .\nI feel if his alveolar lavage is unremarkable , we should obtain one , in an effort to find rejection that would require high - dose immunosuppression .\n3. Adrenal insufficiency :\nHe had some hypotension .\nI have placed him on hydrocortisone 100 milligrams intravenous every 6 .\n4. Moderate mitral regurgitation :\nHis is on afterload reduction with hydralazine .\nHe is also receiving nitrates .\n5. Immunosuppression :\nHe is currently receiving tacrolimus 0.5 milligrams twice a day .\nHis goal is 12 to 15 .\nHis tacrolimus trough today is pending .\n6. Infectious prophylaxis :\nHe is receiving voriconazole 200 milligrams twice a day .\nWe have held his valacyclovir yesterday because of leukopenia .\nHe also is receiving Bactrim prophylaxis .\n7. Chronic renal insufficiency with acute renal failure :\nHis urine output is adequate today with 625 cubic centimeters .\nYesterday , he had 3.4 Liters of urine , and his BUN and creatinine has stabilized 79/1.6 .\nHe is receiving enteric feeds .\nCritical Care time spend exclusive of teaching and procedures provided throughout the day is 85 minutes .\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX] , M.D.\nDictator :\n**NAME[WWW XXX] , M.D.\nPL/lbw\nD :\n**DATE[Apr 27 2007] 08:19:39\nT :\n**DATE[Apr 27 2007] 08:35:00\nR :\n**DATE[Apr 27 2007] 08:35:00/lbw\nJob ID :\n364212/**ID-NUM\n*** Dictated By :\n-**NAME[XXX , QQQ] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[WWW XXX]\n**DATE[Jun 12 2007] 10:25:40 AM\n", "marked_up_text": "**INSTITUTION\n[CRITICAL CARE](133903000) MEDICINE\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN PROGRESS NOTE\n[PATIENT NAME](371484003) :\n**NAME[AAA , BBB M]\nACCOUNT # :\n**ID-NUM\n**ROOM\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN :\n**NAME[WWW M XXX]\nADMISSION DATE :\n**DATE[Apr 12 2007]\n[EVALUATION](129265001) DATE :\n**DATE[Apr 27 07]\nI am personally managing the care of Mr. **NAME[AAA] in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .\nHe is receiving [mechanical ventilation](40617009) for [acute respiratory failure](65710008) .\nI have examined the patient on rounds with the House staff .\nI have reviewed the patient 's data and [radiographs](168537006) .\nEvents in the last 24 hours include temperature spike with significant [hypotension](45007003) requiring [resuscitation](439569004) with crystalloid and [administration](416118004) of [stress](262188008&73595000) dose [corticosteroids](79440004) .\nIMPRESSION :\nThis is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old male with a [past medical history](417662000) for [double lung transplantation](232658009) in **DATE[Jan] of 2006 , for [emphysema](49158009) , who presented on **DATE[Apr 12] , with [dyspnea](267036007) .\nHis course has been significant for transbronchial biopsies that first revealed no acute cellular rejection.
