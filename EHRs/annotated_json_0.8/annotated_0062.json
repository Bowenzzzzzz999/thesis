Cardiovascular :\nThe patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .\nThe patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .\nThe next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .\nThis echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .\nHowever , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .\nIt was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .\nThe patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .\nThis responded to fluid bolus .\nThe patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .\nThe patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .\nThis stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .\nClearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .\n2.
