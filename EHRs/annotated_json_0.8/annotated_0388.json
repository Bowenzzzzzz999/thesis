downs in this area .\nShe had some scars in this area .\nWe put in a triple - lumen catheter without complication with no hematoma into her left femoral vein , and we were able to give her a couple of boluses of IV fluids .\nHer blood pressure improved .\nHer oxygen saturation remained about 100% .\nOnce the line was placed , I re - examined the patient , and she complained of progressive worsening abdominal pain with some guarding in the lower right quadrant .\nThis appeared to be a new finding according to her nurse practitioner , although none of these findings had been reported earlier today .\nThe patient was transferred immediately to a CCU MICU bed for her to be aggressively resuscitated and for her to be studied for possible intra - abdominal sepsis .\nI requested that she have an abdominal CT when she is more stable .\nI , Dr. **NAME[XXX] , was present during the entire resuscitation for a total of 32 minutes .\nThis is not including the time that I spent placing the central line .\nCPT-99291 , central line .\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW VVV XXX] , M.D.\nDictator :\n**NAME[WWW VVV XXX] , M.D.\n**INITIALS\nD :\n**DATE[May 07 2007] 21:19:20\nT :\n**DATE[May 07 2007] 21:29:08\nR :\n**DATE[May 07 2007] 21:29:08/plb\nJob ID :\n336249 /**ID-NUM\n*** Dictated By :\n-**NAME[XXX , UUU VVV] ***\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[WWW XXX]\n**DATE[May 31 2007] 09:57:17 AM\n", "marked_up_text": "**INSTITUTION\n[CRITICAL CARE](133903000) MEDICINE\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN PROGRESS NOTE\n[PATIENT NAME](371484003) :\n**NAME[AAA , BBB M]\nACCOUNT # :\n**ID-NUM\n**ROOM\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN :\n**NAME[YYY M ZZZ]\nADMISSION DATE :\n**DATE[May 06 2007]\n[EVALUATION](129265001) DATE :\n**DATE[May 07 07]\nCONDITION C:\nThis is an **AGE[in 80s]- year -
