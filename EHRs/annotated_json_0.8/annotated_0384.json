Respiratory failure with pulmonary edema .\nThe patient 's oxygen saturation is 98% on AC mode with a rate of 12 , 40% FIO2 , tidal volume of 600 and PEEP of 5 .\nChest x-ray shows severe COPD with pulmonary venous congestions and a questionable left lower lobe infiltrate .\nGiven that the patient 's white blood cell count is unremarkable and the patient has been afebrile , I suspect that the infiltrate is due to volume overload rather to an infection .\nI have therefore given Lasix 20 mg IV times one and will place the patient on a trach mask trial today .\nOvernight , given the patient 's COPD , I will maintain oxygen saturations between 90 and 95% .\nThis will likely mean reducing the FIO2 from 40% to 30 or even 25% .\n2. Hypertension .\nThe patient 's blood pressure is slightly high at 170/80 .\nThe patient is already on his regular antihypertensive medications including metoprolol and Univasc .\nI suspect that his hypertension may be due simply to volume overload and I will wait to see how the diuresis affects the blood pressure before I add an additional medication .\nI have otherwise continued current care including Pepcid and heparin for ICU prophylaxis .\nI have continued enteral nutrition with Crucial at 45 mL / hour , discontinued the arterial line and decreased the sliding scale insulin to a low dose scale q. 6 hours for glycemic control .\nThe time I have spent managing this patient today , exclusive of teaching time and billable procedures , is 40 minutes .\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW M.
