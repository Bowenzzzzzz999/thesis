Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .\nI will be happy to furnish the results .\nThe patient has a history of MI in 1989 .\nEchocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .\nEKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\nWe would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\nPersantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\nThe patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\nIt has been evaluated in the past without success .\nDuring her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\nStudies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\nStudies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\nThis is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\nFlorinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\nIn addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\nThis has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\nCT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .\nA chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .\nA PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .\nThe left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .\nThe patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .\nDopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .\nIt is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\nIt is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\nThe patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\nWe think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\nThis can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\nThe patient has glaucoma .\nHer medications are as listed below .\nHer ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .\nHis name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nPropanolol 5 mg. p.o. t.i.d.
