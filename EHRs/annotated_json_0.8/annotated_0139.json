Nephrology consults :\n**DATE[Feb 29 2007] .\n2. Pulmonary consult on **DATE[Feb 29 2007] .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nJunctional bradycardia .\nWithin a few hours of admission , the patient 's heart rate converted to normal sinus rhythm .\nThe patient continued initially to be bradycardiac .\nHis heart rate was 40 .\nThe patient 's bradycardiac persisted after conversion to normal sinus rhythm and so atenolol was discontinued .\nHowever , the patient was overall stable from a cardiac standpoint and the patient was transferred to the General Medicine A-Service care .\nWhile under the care of the General Medicine Service , the patient was transferred to the Medicine Service on approximately **DATE[Feb 19] .\nHowever , under the care of the Medical Service , the patient developed tachypnea , bradycardia , or hypoxia with a new oxygen requirement of 5 liters nasal cannula .\nThe patient had not been on oxygen at all prior to this time .\nInitial chest x-rays did not reveal any evidence of pulmonary edema .\nThere was concern for pulmonary embolism but a CT study with contrast could not be pursued , as the patient had a significant elevation of creatinine .\nThe patient 's creatinine initially on arrival to the hospital was 5.2 and at the time of his oxygen requirements , his creatinine was still in the 2.5 to 2.7 range .\nThe Medicine Service pursued an evaluation via Doppler studies which did not reveal any evidence of thromboses .\nThe patient also had a VQ scan that was low probability for a pulmonary embolism .\nHis EKG did not show any acute ST or T - wave changes .\nThe troponin were checked which showed an elevation of 1.49 on **DATE[Feb 25 2007] .\nHis troponin earlier in admission when the patient was initially admitted were negative times 3 on **DATE[Feb 18] .\nThe General Medicine Service subsequently consulted the Cardiologist who evaluated the patient and felt that he should return to the care of the Cardiac Pavilion Service .\nMeanwhile , the patient had been treated with heparin drip for presumptive PE treatment and this was continued to for three to four days after his VQ scan did not show PE .\nThis was being done as clear etiology for his shortness of breath which is still not elicited .\nThe patient had transthoracic echocardiogram done on **DATE[Feb 26] which showed some wall motion abnormalities but ejection fraction was only mildly decreased at 45 to 50% .\nThere was moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension as well .\nThe patient was also showing peripheral edema on exam and the volume was thought to be a contributor to his symptoms .\nSeveral chest x-rays to this point has still not shown any interstitial edema but on **DATE[Feb 28] , chest x-ray did begin to pulmonary edema and by this point , pulmonary embolism had been ruled out .\nThe patient was receiving diuretic therapy at smaller levels of Lasix at approximately 20 mg IV twice daily .\nHis creatinine was elevated in the high 2.5 to 2.8 range , so initially these doses were used carefully .\nThere was some verbal report from someone who had reviewed records at the **INSTITUTION that there maybe some possible interstitial lung disease history in the patient and therefore the Pulmonary Service was also consulted for their input , as the primary lung disorder being the etiology of the patient 's dyspnea .\nHowever , further review did not show any sort of evidence of work-up or reason the patient should have interstitial lung disease .\nThis could not be further evaluated because the patient was very , very orthopneic that he could not tolerate a CT scan by laying flat .\nThe patient 's was also seen by the Nephrology Service around that time who recommended more aggressive diuresis .\nThe patient 's diuretic regimen was quickly escalated to 80 mg q. 8 hours .\nIn addition , the Pulmonary Service noted that he had moderate pleural effusions bilaterally on his chest x-ray and recommended therapeutic thoracentesis .\nA therapeutic thoracentesis was done from approximately 100 cc of fluid .\nNo pigtail catheter was placed .\nThis was done on the left side under Interventional Radiology guidance .\nMeanwhile , the patient 's urine output significantly increased with the diuresis and his orthopnea improved .\nThe patient 's O2 requirements began to decrease .\nHe was at 5 liters of oxygen for approximately one weeks duration , but the patient 's diuretics eventually assisted in his overall symptomatic relief .\nEventually , the patient was no longer on any sort of supplemental oxygen and his orthopnea resolved as well .\nOverall , the patient 's symptoms were felt to be due to CHF exacerbation , as the patient was believed to have diastolic dysfunction .\nHe has a history of MR as well and hypertension which maybe playing a role in this .\nCoronary disease :\nOnce the patient began to stabilize from the heart failure exacerbation , furthers cardiac testing was pursued since the patient had a troponin elevation earlier .\nAn adenosine myocardial perfusion nuclear thallium stress study was performed .\nThis was highly suggestive of three - vessel coronary artery disease .\nThe patient 's creatinine at this time had leveled off in the 3.0 range and though there was a risk that the patient may suffer increased kidney injury from dye exposure , it was felt that the patient 's benefits outweigh the risks and that cardiac catheterization should be pursued .\nIt was explained to the patient that risks and benefits of the catheterization and the need for him to be on dialysis as a result .\nHowever , the patient did agree to further work - up , as he may have significant underlying coronary disease that would otherwise go undiagnosed .\nThe cardiac catheterization was performed on **DATE[Mar 05] , that revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease .\nThe patient had a mid 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery just after take off of a moderate sized diagonal branch .\nShe had a left circumflex out of proximal subtotal occlusion and the RCA also had a mid 70 to 80% stenosis .\nSee full cath report for further details , but see the recommendations at that point , we can pursue coronary artery bypass graft surgery .\nThe attending physician , Dr. **NAME[PPP] spoke to the VA hospital Administrators , as well as , VA Telemetry attending , Dr. **NAME[OOO] and the VA hospital agreed to accept the patient for further care of his coronary artery disease and referral evaluation for coronary artery bypass graft surgery .\nAcute kidney injury :\nON chronic kidney disease .\nThe patient presented initially with a creatinine of 5.2 on **DATE[Feb 18] by **DATE[Feb 23] , his creatinine had come down to 2.5 and is felt to be pre - renal in origin .\nSubsequently however , the patient 's creatinine again began to climb , as the patient developed the dyspnea symptoms and his creatinine peaked again to a level of 3.5 on **DATE[Feb 31] .\nThe patient was seen by the Nephrology Service on **DATE[Feb 29] , who followed very closely as the patient was showing evidence of advanced kidney injury and possible need for further renal replacement therapy .\nHowever , they recommended radiographic diuresis and with such treatment , the patient 's excessive fluid was removed and his creatinine levels subsequently stabilized .\nAT the time of this dictation and for the last four days , the patient 's creatinine has leveled off at 3.0 .\nIn addition , the patient was placed on Aranesp for __________ that maybe related to the chronic kidney disease , as well as , supplemental oral bicarbonate .\nIt was 650 mg t.i.d. but on transfer orders this was being placed at b.i.d. since the patient 's bicarb has been slightly elevated at 29 .\nThe patient 's creatinine continues to be monitored as the patient has recently had a cardiac catheterization and ultimately the patient should have outpatient follow up with a Nephrologist due to his advance chronic kidney disease .\nAnemia .\nThe patient 's hemoglobin on presentation was 11.1 .\nThis did bottom out a level of 7.6 on **DATE[Feb 31] .\nAround this time , the patient had been on heparin empirically for PE treatment and the drop occurred during that course .\nThe patient 's stool did have heme positive results on it on **DATE[Feb 29] , but there was no gross blood seen .\nThe patient did receive 2 units of packed red blood cells for transfusion and off the heparin , the hemoglobin did stabilize .\nHypertension :\nThe patient 's blood pressure medications were adjusted during the hospital stay .\nInitially , the patient had been on Norvasc .\nHowever , with the edema , the patient 's Norvasc was titrated to off .\nIn addition his hydralazine was titrated up as well as the patient 's beta blockade .\nOn **DATE[Mar 05] , 32007 , the patient 's beta blockade was increased to 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.\nHe still is hypertensive and will likely need better blood pressure control .\nThere is still room to go up on the patient 's clonidine and also add back calcium channel blocker if need be .\nTRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS :\nDischarge Medications :\n1.

up , as he may have significant underlying coronary [disease](64572001) that would otherwise go undiagnosed .\nThe [cardiac catheterization](41976001) was performed on **DATE[Mar 05] , that revealed three-[vessel coronary artery disease](371803003) .\nThe patient had a mid 80% [stenosis](415582006) in the left anterior descending artery just after [take](419652001) off of a moderate sized diagonal branch .\nShe had a left circumflex out of proximal subtotal [occlusion](26036001&50173008) and the RCA also had a mid 70 to 80% [stenosis](415582006) .\nSee full cath report for further details , but see the recommendations at that point , we can pursue [coronary artery bypass graft](232717009&232719007&67166004&232720001&232721002&232722009&232723004) [surgery](257556004) .\nThe attending physician , Dr. **NAME[PPP] spoke to the VA hospital Administrators , as well as , VA Telemetry attending , Dr. **NAME[OOO] and the VA hospital agreed to accept the patient for further care of his [coronary artery disease](53741008) and [referral](3457005) [evaluation](129265001) for [coronary artery bypass graft](232717009&232719007&67166004&232720001&232721002&232722009&232723004) [surgery](257556004) .\nAcute kidney [injury](19130008&417163006&417746004) :\nON [chronic kidney disease](709044004&714153000&714152005) .\nThe patient presented initially with a creatinine of 5.2 on **DATE[Feb 18] by **DATE[Feb 23] , his creatinine had come down to 2.5 and is felt to be pre - renal in origin .\nSubsequently however , the patient 's creatinine again began to climb , as the patient developed the [dyspnea](267036007) symptoms and his creatinine peaked again to a level of 3.5 on **DATE[Feb 31] .\nThe patient [was seen by the Nephrology Service](305821002) on **DATE[Feb 29] , who followed very closely as the patient was showing evidence of advanced kidney [injury](19130008&417163006&417746004) and [possible](371930009) need for further renal [replacement therapy](182819002) .\nHowever , they recommended [radiographic](168537006) diuresis and with such treatment , the patient 's excessive fluid was removed and his [creatinine levels](365756002) subsequently [stabilized](409051000) .\nAT the time of this dictation and for the last four days , the patient 's creatinine has leveled off at 3.0 .\nIn addition , the patient was placed on Aranesp for __________ that maybe [related](262094002&34822003) to the [chronic kidney disease](709044004&714153000&714152005) , as well as , supplemental [oral](738956005) [bicarbonate](68615006) .\nIt was 650 mg t.i.d. but on transfer orders this was being placed at b.i.d. since the patient 's [bicarb](57376006) has been slightly elevated at 29 .\nThe patient 's creatinine continues to be monitored as the patient has recently [had a cardiac catheterization](41976001) and ultimately the patient should have outpatient follow up with a Nephrologist due to his advance [chronic kidney disease](709044004&714153000&714152005) .\n[Anemia](271737000) .\nThe patient 's hemoglobin on presentation was 11.1 .\nThis did bottom out a level of 7.6 on **DATE[Feb 31] .\nAround this time , the patient had been on [heparin](372877000&84812008) empirically for PE treatment and the drop occurred during that course .\nThe patient 's stool did have heme [positive](10828004) results on it on **DATE[Feb 29] , but there was no gross blood seen .\nThe patient did receive 2 units of [packed red blood cells](431069006) for [transfusion](5447007) and off the [heparin](372877000&84812008) , the hemoglobin did [stabilize](409051000) .\n[Hypertension](38341003) :\nThe patient 's blood [pressure](13543005) medications were adjusted during the hospital stay .\nInitially , the patient had been on Norvasc .\nHowever , with the [edema](267038008&79654002) , the patient 's Norvasc was titrated to off .\nIn addition his [hydralazine](387125005&703113001&22696000) was titrated up as well as the patient 's beta blockade .\nOn **DATE[Mar 05] , 32007 , the patient 's beta blockade was increased to 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.\nHe still is hypertensive and will [likely](2931005) need better blood [pressure](13543005) control .\nThere is still room to go up on the patient 's [clonidine](372805007&62782004) and also [add](56146000) [back calcium channel blocker](373304005) if need be .\nTRANSFER [INSTRUCTIONS](410614008&410615009) :\nDischarge Medications :\n1.
