History of diverticulitis .\nSTUDIES / PROCEDURES :\n1. Hematoma evacuation by orthopedic surgery , Dr. **NAME[VVV] was done on **DATE[Feb 12 2007] .\nIrrigation and debridement of the left buttock hematoma .\n2. Bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were done on **DATE[Feb 13 2007] , showing no evidence of DVT in either leg .\n3. Lower extremity MRI of the left leg showing changes consistent with a partially evacuated hematoma .\nNo specific features of abscess , although superinfection could not be excluded on the basis of that imaging study .\nThere was moderate , strandy edema or hemorrhage within the adductor muscles and the posterior compartment .\nAlso , multiple foci of marrow replacement within the pelvis was seen , most likely related to the known multiple myeloma without pathologic fracture .\nChest x-ray on **DATE[Feb 11 2007] , showed no active disease .\n**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :\nThis is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old man with a past medical history significant for stage IIIB immunoglobulin M lambda multiple myeloma who was admitted on **DATE[Feb 10 2007] , for an intramuscular hematoma while taking Lovenox after a bone marrow biopsy .\nBone marrow biopsy was done on **DATE[Feb 5 2007] .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\n1. Hematoma .\nOn admission , the patient has severe pain and limited range of motion at his left hip secondary to the left buttock hematoma .\nInitially , the anticoagulation with Lovenox was stopped .\nPain was initially controlled with MS Contin and IV Dilaudid for breakthrough pain .\nHowever , later , his pain required a Dilaudid PCA for optimal control .\nThe patient was seen by Dr. **NAME[VVV] from orthopedics on **DATE[Feb 11 2007] , and then taken to the OR on\n**DATE[Feb 12 2007] , for evacuation of the hematoma .\nHis postoperative course was complicated by :\n2. Series of fevers on day 1 postoperatively .\nThese were worked up with lower extremity Dopplers which were negative ; and MRI of the lower extremity which was also negative for any sort of abscess .\nDr. **NAME[UUU] from infectious diseases was also consulted , and intravenous antibiotics with Zosyn and vancomycin were also initiated .\nHowever , all cultures were negative .\nBy postoperative day 2 to 3 , all of the fevers had resolved .\nTherefore , the fever was likely due to postoperative atelectasis which is the most common cause of day 1 postoperative fever .\nThis was treated with incentive spirometry .\n3. Infectious diseases .\nAs stated above , there was a question of an infected hematoma .\nHowever , the MRI of the leg did not show any sort of abscess .\nDr. **NAME[UUU] from infectious diseases was consulted .\nThe patient was treated with IV Zosyn and vancomycin for 6 and 5 days respectively .\nCultures from the Hemovac and blood cultures all remained negative .\nThere was no other explanation for the fever .\nThere was no UTI .\nThe chest x-ray did not show any pneumonia .\nOn discharge , he was put on Augmentin for approximately 9 more days .\n4. Multiple myeloma .\nThis was diagnosed in **DATE[Nov 2006] with a presentation of back pain and serum viscosity of 15 .\nHe received DT - PACE x 1 cycle with refractory disease , then 3 cycles of Velcade , thalidomide , and dexamethasone .\nHowever , the thalidomide was held for two cycles secondary to atrial fibrillation .\nThe long - term plan is for autologous stem cell transplant .\nThis will be addressed as an outpatient by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] .\nOn this admission , his IgM was still high at 6240 .\nDr. **NAME[VVV] requests that chemotherapy with Velcade be held until after his office appointment in approximately 2 weeks in order to monitor the progress of the evacuation of the hematoma prior to restarting chemotherapy .\n5. Cardiovascular. Dr. **NAME[TTT] with cardiology was consulted for clearance prior to autologous stem cell transplant .\nThe patient had not been in atrial fibrillation since thalidomide had been discontinued and a recent stress test from an outside hospital was negative for ischemia and had normal wall motion .\nTherefore , Dr. **NAME[TTT] cleared Mr. **NAME[CCC] for stem cell transplant once these acute issues have resolved .\nHis atenolol was continued throughout hospitalization .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\n1. Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. daily .\n2. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily .\n3. Lipitor 40 mg p.o. nightly .\n4. Neurontin 300 mg p.o. q.8 h .\n5. Dilaudid 1 mg p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. pain .\n6.
