CARDIOVASCULAR :\nThe patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina .\nHowever , given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past , it was thought to be unlikely .\nHowever , the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker , and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated .\nA stress thallium was planned for the day following admission .\nHowever , on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded , and a code was called .\nFurther examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s.\nOver the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive .\nShe was treated with a fluid bolus .\nThe patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive .\nShe reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal .\nShe was able to get to bed at which point she passed out .\nShe denied any chest pain or pressure , and no shortness of breath during this event .\nA rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm .\nAn electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes .\nHer acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response .\nIt was determined to stop the beta blocker , and atropine was placed at the bedside .\nOn the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 .\nHer stress test was cancelled .\nA CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension .\nShe was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry .\nA Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient 's hypotension .\nThere was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease , and given the patient 's Grave's disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible .\nIn addition , consideration was given to sarcoidosis , human immunodeficiency virus , and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use .\nIt was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension .\nIt was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory .\nA right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 .\nA pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response .\nIn addition , a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy .\nTherefore , in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause .\nChronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram .\nChronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in 2012 as well as a normal CT angiogram .\nCollagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however , given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative .\nTherefore , it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension .\nConsideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however , given the patient 's poor response to Lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension .\nTherefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .\nPlans were made for placement of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment .\nHowever , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .\nUpon arrival by the physician the patient was awake , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air .\nShe described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .\nThe patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s.\nReview of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute .\nThe etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .\nGiven the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes , and decreased urine output , she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan therapy .\nOn 12-08 , the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan administration .\nDuring the Mass. Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than 90 .\nShe had no further episodes of bradycardia during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay .\nIn addition , the patient 's urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy , suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload .\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement .\nThis was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place .\nBecause the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan therapy .\nFlolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .\nThe patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan therapy including nausea , vomiting , first bite jaw claudication , or hypotension .\nOver the course of the hospital stay the patient 's Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan overdose .\nThe patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .\nA high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however , the patient refused it at this time .\nPlans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated .\nHowever , on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her Hickman catheter site .\nSurgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .\nA surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding .\nIn addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding .\nFollowing this episode the patient felt like she was \" too stressed \" for pacemaker placement .\nTherefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events .\nOver the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan , and Flolan teaching was continued .\nShe continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness , shortness of breath , and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed .\nHowever , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .\nOn 12-15 , the patient went for placement of a pacemaker .\nShe had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced AV of 150 msec .\nThe patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating her Flolan therapy well .\nShe had received a full course of Flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home .\nShe was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group , and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of Flolan therapy .\nFollowing pacemaker placement the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia on telemetry , and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition .\n2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :\nThe patient had no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of admission .\nHowever , she was noted to have a relatively elevated white blood cell count that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .\nHowever , near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased urinary frequency which persisted once her Foley catheter was removed .\nA urinalysis was positive and urine culture grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive .\nTherefore , the patient was started on levofloxacin therapy to complete a 10 - day course .\nFollowing initiation of the antibiotic the patient 's white blood cell count quickly came down , and she remained afebrile .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient still had a mildly elevated white blood cell count but was asymptomatic with a normal temperature .\nShe will complete two more days of Levaquin therapy as an outpatient .\n3. RENAL :\nThe patient 's BUN and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay .\nThese remained stable and within normal limits .\nIt was felt that the decreased urine output was secondary to her preload dependence , and that her urine output increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .\n4. GASTROINTESTINAL :\nThe patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease .\nShe was continued on Protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues .\n5. HEMATOLOGY :\nThe patient 's hematocrit remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .\nDespite bleeding from the Hickman site , she did not require any transfusion therapy .\n6. FLUIDS / ELECTROLYTES / NUTRITION :\nThe patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay .\nHer electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and remained within normal limits , being replaced as needed .\nShe was discharged to home on a regular diet .\n7. ENDOCRINE :\nThe patient with a history of hypothyroidism .\nShe was continued on her regular Synthroid dose .\nShe will need a TSH and T4 checked as an outpatient .\n8. CODE STATUS :\nThe patient is a full code .\n9. FLOLAN ADMINISTRATION :\nAt the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating a Flolan dose of 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .\nA Physical Therapy consultation was obtained to initiate a 6 - minute walk test .\nOn room air , the patient 's oxygen saturation was 95% and dropped to 88% following a 6 - minute walk .\nThe patient was discharged to home with appropriate Flolan teaching and supplies .\nShe was to follow up with Dr. Savage in the Clinic the following week .\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE :\nThe patient was stable .\nDISCHARGE STATUS :\nShe was discharged to home .\nDISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :\nShe has follow up with Dr. Schwartz in the Clinic on Monday , 12-22 , at 2:30 p.m. to check her INR and digoxin level .\nShe also has follow up with Dr. Savage in the Pulmonary Clinic on 12-25 at 12:15 p.m. for management of her pulmonary hypertension .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n1.

however , given the patient 's poor response to Lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient ['s pulmonary hypertension](70995007) .\nTherefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment .\nPlans were made for [placement](71861002) of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment .\nHowever , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .\nUpon arrival by the physician the patient was [awake](248218005) , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with [pressure](13543005) in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room [air](417696007) .\nShe described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .\nThe patient was [treated with 2](28995006) liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood [pressure](13543005) to the 90 s.\nReview of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of [nonsustained ventricular tachycardia](444658006&426525004) followed by an episode of [bradycardia](48867003) to 60 beats per minute .\nThe etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt [likely](2931005) secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear [pulmonary hypertension](70995007&445237003) , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular [compression](19484001&424128006) by a dilated left ventricle .\nGiven the patient 's persistent [hypotensive episodes](67763001) , [and decreased urine output](718403007) , she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan [therapy](276239002&277132007) .\nOn 12-08 , the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan [administration](416118004) .\nDuring the Mass. Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood [pressure](13543005) with a systolic of greater than 90 .\nShe had no further episodes of [bradycardia](48867003) during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay .\nIn addition , the patient 's [urine output](364202003) [improved](385425000) dramatically with [hydration therapy](243221009) , suggesting her low [urine output](364202003) was secondary [to decreased cardiac output](86318000) secondary to low preload .\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating [severe](24484000) vasal [sensitivity](14788002) with [bradycardia](48867003) necessitating pacemaker [placement](71861002) .\nThis was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place .\nBecause the patient 's [pulmonary](738985004) [pressures](13543005) responded so well to [adenosine](35431001&108502004) during [right heart catheterization](40403005) , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan [therapy](276239002&277132007) .\nFlolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .\nThe patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan [therapy](276239002&277132007) including [nausea](422587007) , [vomiting](422400008) , first [bite](3404009) [jaw claudication](43922008) , or [hypotension](45007003) .\nOver the course of the hospital stay the patient 's Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan [overdose](55680006) .\nThe patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .\nA high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for [possible](371930009) secondary cause of her [primary](261424001) [pulmonary hypertension](70995007&445237003) ; however , the patient refused it at this time .\nPlans for [placement](71861002) of a pacemaker were initiated .\nHowever , on the night prior to the planned [surgical](83578000) date the patient suffered an episode of [bleeding](131148009&50960005) from her Hickman catheter site .\n[Surgery](257556004) was notified [and pressure](257821005) was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .\nA surgicel [dressing](3895009) was placed and prolonged [pressure](13543005) resulted in resolution of the [bleeding](131148009&50960005) .\nIn addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the [bleeding](131148009&50960005) .\nFollowing this episode the patient felt like she was \" too stressed \" for pacemaker [placement](71861002) .\nTherefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further [bleeding](131148009&50960005) events .\nOver the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan , and Flolan teaching was continued .\nShe continued to have occasional episodes of [dizziness](404640003) , [shortness of breath](267036007) , and [hypotension](45007003) whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed .\nHowever , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .\nOn 12-15 , the patient went for [placement](71861002) of a pacemaker .\nShe had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced AV of 150 msec .\nThe patient recovered well from her [surgery](257556004) for pacemaker [placement](71861002) .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating her Flolan [therapy](276239002&277132007) well .\nShe had received a full course of Flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the [administration of the medication](18629005&225425006) at home .\nShe was set up with a [primary](261424001) [pulmonary hypertension](70995007&445237003) [support group](386453008) , and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of Flolan [therapy](276239002&277132007) .\nFollowing pacemaker [placement](71861002) the patient had no further episodes of [bradycardia](48867003) on telemetry , and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition .\n[2. INFECTIOUS DISEASE](40733004) :\nThe patient had no signs or symptoms of [infection](40733004) at the time of admission .\nHowever , she was noted to have a relatively elevated [white blood cell count](767002) that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .\nHowever , near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased [urinary frequency](162116003) which persisted once her Foley catheter was removed .\nA [urinalysis](27171005) was [positive](10828004) and [urine culture](117010004) grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive .\nTherefore , the patient was started on levofloxacin [therapy](276239002&277132007) to complete a 10 - day course .\nFollowing initiation of the antibiotic the patient ['s white blood cell count](767002) quickly came down , and she remained [afebrile](86699002&386661006) .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient still had a mildly elevated [white blood cell count](767002) but was [asymptomatic](84387000) with a normal temperature .\nShe will complete two more days of Levaquin [therapy](276239002&277132007) as an outpatient .\n3. RENAL :\nThe patient 's BUN and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay .\nThese remained stable [and within normal limits](125112009) .\nIt was felt that the [decreased urine output](718403007&718402002) was secondary to her preload [dependence](255338002) , and that her [urine output](364202003) increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .\n4. GASTROINTESTINAL :\nThe patient [has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease](70861000119106) .\nShe was continued on Protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues .\n5. HEMATOLOGY :\nThe patient 's [hematocrit](28317006&365616005) remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .\nDespite [bleeding](131148009&50960005) from the Hickman site , she did not require any [transfusion](5447007) [therapy](276239002&277132007) .\n6. FLUIDS / [ELECTROLYTES](86355000) / NUTRITION :\nThe patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay .\nHer [electrolytes](86355000) were checked on a daily basis and remained within [normal limits](260394003) , being replaced as needed .\nShe was discharged to home on a regular diet .\n7. ENDOCRINE :\nThe patient with a [history of hypothyroidism](161443002) .\nShe was continued on her regular Synthroid dose .\nShe will need a [TSH](65428006) and T4 checked as an outpatient .\n8. CODE STATUS :\nThe patient is a full code .\n9. FLOLAN [ADMINISTRATION](416118004) :\nAt the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating a Flolan dose of 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .\nA Physical [Therapy](276239002&277132007) [consultation](11429006) was obtained to initiate a 6 - [minute walk test](252478000&252479008) .\nOn room [air](417696007) , the patient 's [oxygen](24099007) saturation was 95% and dropped to 88% following a 6 - minute walk .\nThe patient was discharged to home with appropriate Flolan teaching and supplies .\nShe was to follow up with Dr. Savage in the Clinic the following week .\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE :\nThe patient was stable .\n[DISCHARGE STATUS](309039003) :\nShe was discharged to home .\nDISCHARGE FOLLOWUP :\nShe has follow up with Dr. Schwartz in the Clinic on Monday , 12-22 , at 2:30 p.m. to check her INR and [digoxin level](365735004) .\nShe also has follow up with Dr. Savage in the [Pulmonary](738985004) Clinic on 12-25 at 12:15 p.m. for management of her [pulmonary hypertension](70995007&445237003) .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n1.
