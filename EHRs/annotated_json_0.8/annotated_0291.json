Acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction which began on the evening of **DATE[Oct 27 2007] .\n2. Severe multivessel coronary artery disease .\n3. The patient has a history of 5 previous myocardial infarctions .\n4. In **DATE[Apr 2005] , the patient underwent multivessel coronary artery bypass surgery .\n5.

Persistent tobacco abuse .\n10. Status post cervical laminectomy .\n11. The patient is relatively noncompliant .\nHISTORY :\nThis patient is a **AGE[in 50s]- year - old gentleman with severe premature coronary artery disease .\nApparently , his father had a myocardial infarction at the age of **AGE[in 40s] , and he had a brother who also suffered a myocardial infarction at 48 .\nAll the siblings in the family have a history of hypertension .\nThis patient developed a symptomatic coronary artery disease several years ago .\nHe had coronary stents placed by another cardiologist but neither apparently maintained satisfactory patency and subsequently , the patient underwent multivessel bypass surgery in **DATE[Apr 2005] .\nWe were told it was 7 - vessel bypass surgery but the exact grafts were not currently available .\nThe patient developed chest pain on the evening of **DATE[Oct 21 2007] .\nIt began at rest .\nIt was fairly significant .\nHe presented to the emergency room where his first enzymes were really not elevated but the patient had ST - T wave changes in the lateral leads of the electrocardiogram .\nSubsequent to that , he was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nPlease check the admitting note .\nThere are no additions to that note .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nAfter admission to the hospital , the patient was started on heparin and oral Plavix or clopidogrel .\nHe had a repeat troponin I done at 10:30 a.m. on **DATE[Oct 22 2007] , and that clearly showed a marked elevation in his troponin to 17.5 .\nFor that reason , a decision was made to take the patient to the catheterization laboratory .\nThe patient went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on **DATE[Oct 22 2007] .\nDespite his very ominous finding past medical history including the history of five previous myocardial infarctions , this patient still has an ejection fraction estimated at 50% .\nHis grafts include the following :\nThe patient has a patent sequential LIMA to the diagonal and to a left anterior descending artery .\nNo progression of the disease in the native left anterior descending artery beyond this LIMA graft .\nHe has a dominant circumflex artery .\nThere is a totally occluded vein graft to a medium sized ramus intermedius artery .\nThis is presumably the acute event .\nHe had a patent vein graft to fairly large obtuse marginal artery but this obtuse marginal artery had proximal 80% stenosis which prevented adequate retrograde filling of the dominant circumflex artery .\nThe same circumflex artery has a long segmental distal 80% stenosis which is a critical lesion which will require attention in the near future .\nThe right coronary artery is a codominant vessel in that it supplies a small posterior descending branch .\nThere is a remote stent in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery which has abruptly occluded shortly after the stent .\nThere is a small vein graft into a right ventricular branch which sends some collaterals to the distal portion of the occluded right coronary artery but the amount of collateralization is not very prominent .\nFinally , a prominent proximal conus branch which is fairly large caliber vessel has segmental 90% lesions .\nOn this occasion , we were able to reopen the totally occluded vein graft to the ramus intermedius artery .\nThis graft was filled with thrombus .\nWe had to use a thrombectomy catheter with multiple passes before I put in 2 sequential Taxus 3.5 mm drug eluting stents with good results in the graft but this vein graft has distal anastomotic 50% stenosis .\nThe patient had adequate flow through the vein graft into the obtuse marginal artery .\nHe was treated with intravenous eptifibatide and continued on potent antiplatelet agents .\nThe day after the procedure , he was completely asymptomatic even with ambulation in the hall and was chomping at the bid to go home .\nHe has normal sinus rhythm at 74 per minute .\nHis total CPK peaked at 482 with an MB fraction that peaked at 23.7.\nThis would fit with the fact that the ramus intermedius artery is not a very large vessel and even occlusion of this vessel would not be expected to produce a large infarct .\nThe patient will be allowed to go home on a good medical therapy , and he will follow up in 3 to 4 weeks at which time I will reassess the stented vein graft , and I plan on putting a drug eluting stent in the distal portion of the dominant circumflex artery as this is the more worrisome lesion with his current anatomy .\nThe patient actually forgot to tell the staff when I came in that he was on thyroid replacement therapy , so he did not get his medicine for a couple of days .\nWhen I mentioned this to he and his girlfriend , I got the impression he had not been taking it faithfully at home .\nThis may account for the fact that his lipids have been too elevated .\nIn addition , the patient was back to smoking cigarettes and tells me he has now stopped smoking completely .\nI hope that he sticks to that resolution as this patient has fairly significant diffuse disease and if the progression is not stopped , his long - term outlook will be guarded .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\nThe discharge medications on this occasion are the following :\n1. Acetaminophen 650 mg p.r.n.\n2. Enteric - coated aspirin 325 mg daily .\n3. Plavix 75 mg daily .\n4. Lipitor 80 mg daily .\n5. Add omega-3 fish oil supplement 2000 mg daily .\n6. Add lisinopril 10 mg daily at bedtime .\n7. Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.\n8. Multivitamin 1 daily .\n9. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg tablet sublingually p.r.n.\n10. Protonix 40 mg daily or omeprazole 20 mg daily as needed for reflux esophagitis .\nBecause of the institution of lisinopril , he will need to check his BUN , creatinine and electrolytes in 2 to 3 weeks .\nACTIVITY :\nI told the patient he could not return to work or do heavy lifting until he returns to get stenting of the circumflex artery which will be approximately 3 weeks .\nI made it a point to explain to him the importance of taking his medicines exactly as prescribed and to stop smoking cigarettes completely .\n______________________________\n**NAME[YYY M XXX] , MD\nHS Job # 913985 / 38636 / 16547\nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD :\n**DATE[Oct 23 2007] 19:27\nT :\n**DATE[Oct 24 2007] 15:32\n**CARBON-COPY\n", "marked_up_text": "**INSTITUTION\nDischarge Summary\nName :\n**NAME[AAA , BBB]\nAcct # :\n**ID-NUM\nMRN :\n**ID-NUM\nAdmitted :\n**DATE[Oct 21 2007]\nDischarged :\n**DATE[Oct 24 2007]\nDict :\n**NAME[XXX , YYY]\nAttend :\n**NAME[ZZZ , YYY]\nADMITTING PHYSICIANS :\n1.
