Hospital - acquired pneumonia .\nAt this time , continue Zosyn and vancomycin .\nThe patient had sputum cultures / tracheal aspirate done on **DATE[Nov 12] that showed multiple epithelial cells , moderate WBC s , however the cultures did not grow except for normal oropharyngeal flora .\nAt this time , we will continue Zosyn and vancomycin to continue the 14 - day course .\n2. Respiratory distress .\nAt this time , I think the probable cause of her respiratory distress is either worsening pneumonia versus her right - sided pleural effusion .\nThe patient had an ABG done and it showed that her pH was 7.24 and her PCO2 was 68 , PaO2 was 96 , and bicarb was 28 .\nAt this time , I will give her 40 mg of IV Lasix and also some Duo Nebs .\nThe patient might need BiPAP since she is retaining CO2 .\nThe patient will be transferred to medical ICU for BiPAP and also for IV diuresis .\nThe patient may also need an echocardiogram to evaluate for LV function .\n3. The patient has only one IV access and the patient is refusing blood work at this time .\nWe will start giving her FFP since her INR was 2.9 so that she can get a STAT central lumen catheter for blood work and IV antibiotics .\n4. Continue the GI prophylaxis .\n5. Will continue the psych consult at this time .\n6. I discussed with Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] at the MICU and the patient was accepted by Dr. **NAME[SSS] .\nThe patient will be transferred to the MICU at this time .\nI discussed with the doctors extensively and doctors agreed for all the intervention including IV antibiotics , BiPAP , anti __________ agent , inotropic agent , and defibrillation , however they said the patient would be\nDNI , no intubation and no ventilation , however they want everything else done for the patient except for intubation and ventilation .\nAt this time , the patient is only DNI .\nThe total time spent on the patient was at least 1 hour 30 minutes .\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW M.
