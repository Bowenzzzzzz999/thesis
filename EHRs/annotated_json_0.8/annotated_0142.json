HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\nShe used the pill for five years in the past .\nShe is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .\nShe has a history of easy bruis ability .\nShe is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .\nMEDICATIONS :\nMS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .\nFAMILY HISTORY :\nNoncontributory .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nMarried with two children .\nShe worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .\nShe denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nA cachectic white female .\nT 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .\nHEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .\nNeck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\nLungs were clear .\nChest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .\nCardiovascular - Normal .\nAbdomen - Normal .\nThere was no HSM .\nExtremities - Her left arm was very swollen .\nIt was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .\nThere was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .\nNeuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .\nShe also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .\nCranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .\nToes were downgoing .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOf note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\nPT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\nALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\nThat has been stable .\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\nSo that has really improved .\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\nHer INR is 2.3 .\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\nShe is also a little dry .\nThe patient is on oxygen .\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\nDISPOSITION :\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nFair .\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\nThe appointment has already been made .\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\nDictated By :\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE , M.D.\nAttending :\nLA INEMACISTIN PRONTMANDES , M.D. HD45 SY882/1177\nBatch :\n020\nIndex No.\nYJQI3J9VU6\nD :\n01/25/94\nT :\n01/25/94\n", "marked_up_text": "186890029\nSH\n58809909\n1/5/1994 12:00:00 AM\nDischarge Summary\nSigned\nDIS\nAdmission Date :\n01/05/1994\n[Report Status](308552006) :\nSigned\nDischarge Date :\n01/25/1994\nPRINCIPLE [DIAGNOSIS](439401001) :\n[METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA](4590003) OF THE BREAST .\nOTHER [PROBLEMS](55607006) :\n1.

myelosuppression](370569000) .\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a [flu-like illness](95891005) , followed by [fever](386661006) , [nonproductive cough](11833005&28743005) [and dyspnea on exertion](60845006) .\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\n[Chest x-ray](399208008) showed diffuse interstitial [infiltrates](47351003) .\nThe [differential diagnosis](47965005) included viral [pneumonitis](205237003) , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall [nodules](27925004) which turned out to be [tumor](108369006) recurrences and biopsied .\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , [bone scan](41747008) , head and liver CT were [negative](260385009) for metastatic [disease](64572001) .\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose [chemotherapy](367336001&363688001) with GCSF and peripheral stem cell [support](243114000) .\n[Complications](116223007) has mainly included

Cipro .\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some [lymphangitic](1415005) spread versus some [pneumonitis](205237003) .\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of [thiotepa](387508004&88997008) and Velban and [Methotrexate](387381009&68887009) , which required some [red](386713009) cell [transfusions](5447007) .\nIn mid May she was admitted for [fever](386661006) and [neutropenia](165517008&303011007) and at that time had a UTI with [blood clots](75753009) in the urine .\nThe patient [presents](52101004&10828004) today with

.\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , [positive](10828004) for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\n[Chest x-ray](399208008) - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left [pleural effusion](60046008) with no evidence of [pneumonia](233604007) .\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post [chemotherapy](367336001&363688001) with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with [fever](386661006) , four days of [diarrhea](62315008) , [nausea and vomiting](16932000) and had been on Keflex for an [erythema](247441003&70819003) on her left chest wall .\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the [diarrhea](62315008) .\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous [induration](45147008&19730000) and [possible](371930009) [cellulitis](128045006&385627004) with IV antibiotics .\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local [wound care](225358003&42149003) with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol [chemotherapy](367336001&363688001) , which the patient declined .\nShe refused the Taxol [therapy](276239002&277132007) so that was not done .\nAnother [major](24484000) issue with this patient was [pain control](225782006) .\nShe had been in a whole lot of [pain](22253000) from her left arm [lesion](52988006&49755003) .\nSo [pain control](225782006) was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for [pain management](278414003) .\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic [block](26036001) at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\nAfter that the patient had minimal [relief](224978009) of [pain](22253000) .\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were [offered](410527000) to her .\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on [fentanyl](373492002&40648001) [patch](1522000) .\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the [fentanyl](373492002&40648001) [patch](1522000) which is changed every 72 hours .\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the [fentanyl](373492002&40648001) [patch](1522000) as needed to control her [pain](22253000) and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of [pain](22253000) .\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained [ahead CT](303653007&408754009) for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking [and altered mental status](419284004&1855002) , which was [probably](2931005) due to the [morphine](373529000&73572009) that she was taking .\nWe went ahead and got a [head CT](303653007&408754009) scanand it showed no enhancing [lesions](52988006&49755003) .\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient [wanted](410526009) to wait on that .\nThat has been stable .\nThe patient on January 13 became [hyponatremic](89627008) .\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\nA renal consult was obtained and their [assessment](386053000&129265001) was that this was [probably](2931005) a mixture of [hypovolemia](28560003) as well as [SIADH](55004003) .\nWe proceeded to do for her [hyponatremia](89627008) - we gave her some fluid and her [urine sodium](104935006) became higher than her [serum sodium](104934005) ; we stopped it .\nWe had given her some [normal saline](262003004) and then we proceeded to just [do fluid restriction](25389001) .\nIn addition we gave her a [sodium chloride](387390002&70379000) one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\nSo that has really [improved](385425000) .\nWe suggest continuing increased [salt](70379000&387390002) intake in her diet and also continuing with the [fluid restriction](25389001) of free [water](11713004&346712003) intake to one liter per day .\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased [shortness of breath](267036007) and [chest x-ray](399208008) was taken showed a wedge shaped [infiltrate](47351003) in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\nSo we proceeded to put her on [heparin](372877000&84812008) for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on [heparin](372877000&84812008) , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\nHer INR is 2.3 .\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\nOther [major](24484000) issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her [hyponatremia](89627008) and also the other [problems](55607006) , her blood [pressure](13543005) was elevated also .\nWe put her on [nifedipine](387490003&85272000) IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood [pressure](13543005) which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on [atenolol](387506000&87652004) .\nSo on discharge she is on [atenolol](387506000&87652004) 100 .\nIf needed to you can give her some [nifedipine](387490003&85272000) SL to decrease her blood [pressure](13543005) .\nThe patient also has significant [edema](267038008&79654002) in both arms now and also some mild [edema](267038008&79654002) in the lower extremities , so I think that [fluid restriction](25389001) should help with that .\nShe is also a little dry .\nThe patient is on [oxygen](24099007) .\nEver since the [pulmonary](738985004) [embolus](55584005) she has been on [oxygen](24099007) .\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\nWe would like for her to remain on the [oxygen](24099007) as well .\nThe [complications](116223007) that I have listed include the [hyponatremia](89627008) , [pulmonary](738985004) [embolus](55584005) and also the elevatd blood [pressure](13543005) .\nDISPOSITION :\nDischarge medications - [Baclofen](387342009&6102009) 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the [rash](112625008&271807003) in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. [fentanyl](373492002&40648001) [patch](1522000) 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , [atenolol](387506000&87652004) 100 mg p.o. q.d.\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nFair .\nShe remains very weak and will most [likely](2931005) benefit from some physical [therapy](276239002&277132007) andshe still has the bilateral [edema](267038008&79654002) .\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\nThe appointment has already been made .\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her [pain](22253000) primarily [and her difficulty breathing](230145002) .\nDictated By :\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE , M.D.\nAttending :\nLA INEMACISTIN PRONTMANDES , M.D. HD45
