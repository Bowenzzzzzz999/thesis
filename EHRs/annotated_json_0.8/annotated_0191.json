05 2007]\nADDENDUM\nThe patient was to [be discharged from the hospital](183665006) on **DATE[May 23 2007] or **DATE[May 24 2007] .\nHe went to IR for a PICC line [placement](71861002) for outpatient antibiotics .\nWhile on [venogram](4970003) , a subclavian [thrombus](396339007) was visualized .\nAt that time , we started the patient on a [heparin](372877000&84812008) drip and monitored his INR .\nWe [wanted](410526009) to reach an INR of 2.0 prior to discharge .\nWe thought that we would be [able](371150009) to send the patient home with Lovenox and Coumadin .\nHowever , the patient developed [acute renal failure](129561000119108&14669001) .\nHis creatinine had increased to 1.8 .\nFor that reason , we maintained the patient on [heparin](372877000&84812008) and Coumadin firmly .\nAs mentioned , his creatinine had increased to 1.8 .\nWe got a renal [ultrasound](16310003) that was normal .\nWe continued to hydrate the patient .\nHowever , his creatinine remained elevated .\nWe consulted Renal Service to help us with his [evaluation](129265001) .\nTheir [recommendation](420227002) was , if okay with [Infectious Disease](40733004&160279000) , to [discontinue](410546004) the Bactrim to see if he would have a drop in his creatinine .\nOnce off the Bactrim , his creatinine slowly trended back to normal .\nAs part of his [evaluation](129265001) , he did have a urine [eosinophil](419455006&418928000) sent and this was [negative](260385009) .\nOn **DATE[May 23 2007] , once his creatinine was back to normal , we spoke with Renal , and they said that it was okay for us to start him on Lovenox .\nIt will be important that we watch his BUN and creatinine while he is still on the Lovenox .\nWhile here , the patient continued to have this persistent [abdominal pain](21522001&162037008) .\nHe did not have any fevers or [chills](43724002) at this time , however , had continued [nausea](422587007) .\nWe did an abdominal film on **DATE[May 28 2007] , and he had stool throughout his GI track .\nHe was put on a bowel regime with good outcome .\nWe also had General [Surgery](257556004) evaluate the patient as well .\nWe had a CT scan done on **DATE[May 29 2007] , that showed just a resolving [abscess](128477000&44132006) .\nThe spleen , kidney , and pancreas and the visualized bowel were normal .\nBecause this [abdominal pain](21522001&162037008) really never went away , we reconsulted GI .\nThey reported that with CGD you can sometimes have granulomatous [infiltration](231287002&47351003) of the GI tract .\nIt is somewhat reported in about 33% of the patients with CGD .\nThey said that this can only be confirmed through a [colonoscopy](73761001) with [biopsy](86273004) .\nHis last [colonoscopy](73761001) was in **DATE[May 2006] , and was normal except for showing some [internal hemorrhoid](90458007) .\nA repeat [colonoscopy](73761001) was done on **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , that was normal .\nA [biopsy](86273004) was taken at this time and is still pending .\nTheir [recommendation](420227002) was to allow the patient to advance his diet .\nOn **DATE[May 30 2007] , the patient developed [fever](386661006) to 38.6 .\nIt was an isolated [fever](386661006) .\nAt that time , we really did not have an etiology .\nWe did [blood cultures](30088009) on that day and they were [negative](260385009) x 3 days .\nWe also had a second set of [cultures](703725008&61594008) done on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] , and these were [negative](260385009) x 1 day .\nWe did really not have a reason for his [fever](386661006) , and he has been [afebrile](86699002&386661006) in the past 48 hours .\nFor final recommendations by [Infectious Disease](40733004&160279000) , we [discontinued](410546004) his vancomycin on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .\nWe kept the Zosyn and then on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , [discontinued](410546004) the Zosyn , and we will start ceftriaxone .\nHe will resume his rifampin , which was started on **DATE[Jun 2 2007] .\nHe would not require any IV antibiotics at discharge .\n[Abdominal pain](21522001&162037008) :\nAfter the [colonoscopy](73761001) , the patient said that he had increased [pain](22253000) after this [procedure](71388002) .\nWe discussed this with General [Surgery](257556004) .\nThey evaluated the patient and ordered a [CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis](418394000) to rule out any free [air](417696007) or [bleeding](131148009&50960005) .\nThis was [negative](260385009) .\nGI recommended another abdominal film that showed a gas - filled colon that is expected following a [colonoscopy](73761001) .\nThe patient had [decreasing](260371004) white count since admission .\nAs expected with his [infection](40733004) , his white count was 10.6 on admission .\nHowever , after his antibiotics , his white count came down between 4 and 5 .\nAround **DATE[Jun 1 2007] , his white count dropped from 4.4 down to 2.3 .\nAt the same time , his absolute neutrophils had gone from the 2 to 3 range , on **DATE[Jun 3 2007] , down to 0.80 .\nThis may have been caused by the vancomycin or the Zosyn .\nThe [recommendation](420227002) is to see if the absolute [neutrophil count](30630007) increases after the patient is [offered](410527000) the vancomycin and Zosyn for a day or two .\nWe have placed the patient in [neutropenic](165517008&303011007) precautions until we see this level increase .\nFOLLOWUP APPOINTMENTS :\n1.
