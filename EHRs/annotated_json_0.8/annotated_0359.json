Pulmonary hypertension which is likely due to mitral valve disease .\nh. MR 4 +. i .\nLeft renal artery stenosis 90% .\n3. Left renal artery stent by Interventional Radiology .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient is a **AGE[in 70s]- year-old lady with past medical history listed below who was admitted with DKA secondary to non - Q - wave MI .\nApparently , the patient checked blood glucose at home which showed critical high , after which she presented to the emergency room .\nWas found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydrated .\nShe was then admitted to the ICU for malignant of DKA .\nHowever , her troponin level was noted to have increased from 1.89 to 5.19 with increase in CPK from 160 to 240 and CPK-MB from 5.7 to\n12.6 .\nThe patient was rehydrated and medically managed in the ICU , after which she underwent cardiac catheterization with the above report .\nThroughout the episodes of illness , the patient denied any chest pain .\nShe had mild shortness of breath and generalized weakness .\nThe patient 's condition improved very well during the admission .\nDuring the cardiac catheterization , she was noted to have left renal artery stenosis up to 90% for which she had cardiac catheterization as described above .\nA recommendation was made for her to have her mitral valve regurgitation repair ; however , the patient declined the procedure stating that her mother had mitral valve regurgitation and she lived for many years without having any problem .\nThe patient also had a carotid Doppler done which showed 0 to 39% on both sides .\nThe patient was managed on the following issues during admission and discharge :\n1. DKA .\nThe patient 's diabetic ketoacidosis was secondary to the non - Q - wave MI as mentioned above .\nShe was initially managed on insulin infusion .\nLater on , switched to insulin sliding scale .\nShe is going to be discharged home on home medication which is Humulin 70/30 insulin , 40 units , a.c. before breakfast and then 28 units a.c. before dinner .\nShe will continue to check her insulin glucose at home .\n2. Coronary artery disease .\nThe patient has had CABG in the past , that was about 6 to 7 years ago .\nShe has graft ( _______________ ) native vessels occluded OM circumflex done .\nEstimated EF is 25% .\nThere are no symptoms of pulmonary hypertension .\nNo edema or CHF .\nAt the moment , she is in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy .\na. She has high risk for OHS due to comorbidities .\nb. If she agrees to surgery , we need to do surgery with antiplatelets on board which will lead to more transfusion .\nc. She will benefit from dual - chamber biventricular ICD regardless of whether she has the OHS or not .\nd. Her left ventricle is dilated and weak .\nEven when the mitral regurgitation is fixed , this will lead to increase afterload to the left ventricle .\nThis will place more strain on the already weak heart ; so , the recommendations are we change the metoprolol to Coreg 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.\nWe will avoid aldosterone antagonist as this will likely affect her potassium which is already on the high side .\nThere is a question of if left circumflex system could be revascularized if she happens to go to the OR for the mitral valve replacement ; so , the patient will go home on the medications listed below to follow up with Cardiology .\n3. Renal artery stenosis .\nFor this , she had a renal stent as stated above .\nWe will monitor her potassium levels .\nHer renal function is normal at the moment .\n4. Hypertension .\nBlood pressure is stable at the moment .\nWe will continue her on the Coreg .\nMonitor her blood pressure as needed .\n5. Diabetes type 2 .\nShe will go home on her usual medications .\n6. History of CHF .\nFor this , we will continue her on the digoxin .\nThe patient is being discharged home on the following medications :\n1. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily .\n2. Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily .\n4. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily .\n5. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily .\n6. Humulin insulin 70/30 , 40 units in the a.m. , 28 units in p.m.\n7. Zocor 40 mg p.o. daily .\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. **NAME[RRR QQQ] as an outpatient at the **INSTITUTION , **INSTITUTION .\nShe will follow up with Cardiology as an outpatient as well .\nThe cardiologist had a long discussion with the patient 's son as regards the need for the procedure , the risk , and the benefit .\nAt the moment , they are undecided on whether she is going to get a procedure or not .\n______________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX] , resident\nHS Job # 366005 / 38374 / 33277\nSHY # **ID-NUM\nD :\n**DATE[Dec 08 2007] 15:09\nT :\n**DATE[Dec 11 2007] 08:44\n**CARBON-COPY\n", "marked_up_text": "**INSTITUTION\nDischarge Summary\nName :\n**NAME[AAA , BBB]\nAcct # :\n**ID-NUM\nMRN :\n**ID-NUM\nAdmitted :\n**DATE[Nov 31 2007]\nDischarged :\n**DATE[Dec 08 2007]\nDict :\n**NAME[XXX , WWW]\nAttend :\n**NAME[ZZZ , YYY]\nCONSULTS :\n1.
