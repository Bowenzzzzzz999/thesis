nine months prior to admission , and status post prolonged recent Retelk County Medical Center stay for Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , complicated by ARS due to medication toxicity , as well as GVHD and recent CMV infection , readmitted for new fever , increasing creatinine , hepatomegaly and fluid surge spacing , in the setting of hyponatremia .\nPatient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .\nIn November , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .\nStarted Campath in July , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in December , 2002 .\nThe patient had bone marrow biopsy , August , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .\nHe was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .\nPatient was hospitalized September 26 to November 11 for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .\nID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .\nSubsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .\nPatient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .\nHe has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .\nHypercapture near end of stay was negative .\nPatient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .\nPatient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .\nCellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts

phosphatase 215 , total bilirubin 1.1 , albumin 2.6 , white blood cell count 2.0 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelets 60 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nPatient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .\nWorkup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .\nBlood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on November 20 , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .\nA repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .\nA repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of November 9 , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .\nIn the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .\nInfectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .\nPentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .\nClinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .\nIdiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .\nHowever , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .\nMost likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .\nA single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on November 20 indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .\nPatient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .\nOn November 30 , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .\nDecision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .\nPentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .\nDNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .\nThe patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .\nTylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .\nSuch measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains comfortable through this time .\nThis interim dictation to be followed by an addendum detailing end of hospital course .\nDictated

.\n[Pentamidine](372699006&31692006) intravenous and [nasal](738948007) washings were continued .\nClinical progression of skin and [sinus](419351001) [infection](40733004) on maximal [antimicrobial](250428009) [therapy](276239002&277132007) continued , with emergence on November 20 of a new right-sided [ptosis](11934000&29696001) in association with a [left homonymous hemianopsia](55634009&34063005) , and fleeting [confusion](40917007) while [febrile](386661006&86699002) , prompting head [MRI](113091000) which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right

and [cyclosporine](387467008&80906007) was [discontinued](410546004) .\nHowever , much more [likely](2931005) explanation is progressive [infection](40733004) of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .\nMost [likely](2931005) [source](260753009) of fevers was judged to be progressive [Acanthamoeba infection](49649001) , even on maximal [antimicrobial](250428009)

PICC line and a [chest x-ray](399208008) on November 20 indicating [possible](371930009) developing [pneumonia](233604007) , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both [possible](371930009) [pneumonia](233604007) , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba [sinusitis](36971009) .\nPatient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of [skin infection](19824006) , more frequent episodes of [confusion](40917007) , and [decreasing](260371004) [oxygen](24099007) saturation in the setting of bilateral [effusion](41699000) , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .\nOn November 30 , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with [primary](261424001) oncologist , Dr. Tomedankell Bile , attending physician , Dr. Mellerny Close , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , [sinus](419351001) and neurological [Acanthamoeba infection](49649001) on maximal [antimicrobial](250428009) [therapy](276239002&277132007) .\nDecision was made to [withdraw](247755007) aggressive measures of care ,

, along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .\n[DNR](304253006) / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .\nThe patient was made comfortable with [morphine](373529000&73572009) for [pain](22253000) and for [air hunger](399322006) , and [sinus](419351001) suctioning was continued to relieve [congestion](85804007) , in conjunction with continuation of [nasal](738948007) sprays .\nTylenol was continued to control fevers and [prednisone](116602009&116603004&10312003) was continued to control [inflammation](23583003&257552002) and prevent precipitation of [adrenal insufficiency](386584007&723188008&42399005) .\nSuch measures have been continued through December 3 , and patient remains
