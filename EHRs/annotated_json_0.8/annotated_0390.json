then , Dr. Thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .\nHe had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .\nA paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .\nAfter surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .\nHe was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .\nHe had good hemodynamics .\nHe had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .\nHe was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .\nOn 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .\nTherefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .\nHe remained in normal sinus rhythm .\nHe did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .\nHe had a right bundle branch block .\nHe is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .\nTherefore he was able to be discharged home .\nHe understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ;
