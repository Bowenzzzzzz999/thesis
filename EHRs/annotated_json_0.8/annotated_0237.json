Elevated LFTs :\nLFTs wre elevated at presentation .\nInitially the differential was thought to include shock liver from hypotension , hepatitis , cholangitis or choledocholithiasis .\nHepatitis serologies were negative and the pt was eventually felt to have had shock liver from her hypotensive episode as the transaminitis resolved over time .\n3. Hypoparathyroidism :\nThis is a chronic problem .\ncalcium levels were followed with a goal to keep them around 8.0 by continuing Calcium carbonate , calcitriol .\nThe pt required calcium gluconate x1 the day prior to discharge .\nPer endocrine at the time of discharge , the pt may need an increase in calcium PO , but at this time they recommended no change .\nIt will need to be monitored over time .\n4. Addison 's- The patient is on basal prednisone / fludrocortisone .\nThese were initially continued as above and later , when she became hypotensive and febrile , stress dose steroids were started and planned for a 7 day course followed by a return to her prior dose of prednisone .\nAt the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion ,\nNa was elevated , as was blood pressure .\nOn recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms. ) .\n5.
