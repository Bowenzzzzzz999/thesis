**NAME[AAA] was admitted as a fall .\nHe was found to have a left subdural hematoma .\nHe also has a history of seizure disorder and a biomechanical mitral valve replacement in the past .\nHe has been orally intubated and mechanically ventilated .\nHe has had failure to recover consciousness until recently .\nThe family and the nursing staff tells me that he does follow commands today at least with his left thumb , which he raises in response to command .\nThe patient 's temperature is 37 .\nBlood pressure is 120/60 .\nPulse is 60 .\nThere are both atrial and ventricular pacer spikes , occasionally present , indicating that the patient has apparently a DDD pacemaker .\nHe is ventilated in the assist control mode at a rate of 14 , 650 ml tidal volume , 40% FiO2 and 5 of PEEP .\nOn those settings peak inspiratory pressure is in the mid 20s and he has unlabored ventilation .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nSignificant for clear breath sounds bilaterally .\nHeart is regular rate and rhythm .\nHis abdomen is soft , nontender , and not distended .\nThere are positive bowel sounds .\nThere is 1 + peripheral edema , and he is receiving SCD s for DVT prophylaxis .\nFree Dilantin level is 2.1 .\nPotassium is 2.8 .\nBUN and creatinine are normal .\nPhosphorous is 1.6 .\nWhite blood cell count is normal .\nHe is tolerating Osmolite 20 ml / h. as well as cefepime day 2 , insulin , Keppra , Pantoprazole , Dilantin , and vancomycin .\nEEG was reported as having no seizures .\nAs the patient has no fever and no white blood cell count and cultures are negative , I am going to discontinue the cefepime and vancomycin .\nI am changing the Keppra to p.o. from IV .\nI will speak to Neurosurgery and Neurology regarding potentially decreasing the Dilantin dose .\nI am going to replace the patient 's phosphate to try to get his phosphate level up into the normal range .\nI am going to decrease his IV fluids in an effort to allow him to be fluid negative .\nI will continue him on his tube feeds and increase them as tolerated .\nTo try to augment diuresis , I am going to give the patient some spironolactone .\nI am choosing this instead of our usual Lasix because of his persistent hypokalemia .\nIt is my hope that using this agent I can both affect some diuresis and correct his potassium .\nI will do a CPAP trial on the patient , and if he tolerates that well , and if he is able to guard his airway well we can consider extubation sometime in the near future .\nHowever , today his mental status is clearly not adequate to tolerate that .\nTotal time taken in the care of this critically ill patient is **AGE[in 40s] minutes .\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW XXX] , M.D.\nDictator :\n**NAME[WWW XXX] , M.D.\n**INITIALS\nD :\n**DATE[Aug 20 2007]
