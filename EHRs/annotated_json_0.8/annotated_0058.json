Medical Center .\nAs the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .\nThere was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .\nAt the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .\nSubsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .\nGiven all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .\nThe patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .\nThe patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .\nHe did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .\n2. Hypertension .\n3. Status post hernia repair .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\n1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\n2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\n4. Hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day .\n5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .\nALLERGIES :\nNo known drug allergies .\nFAMILY HISTORY :\nNoncontributory .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nThe patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .\nHead , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :\nnegative .\nNeck was supple .\nThere was no jugular venous distention .\n2+ carotids without bruits .\nCardiovascular exam :\nregular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .\nExtremities :\nthe patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .\nLABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :\nSodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .\nThe patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .\nThe patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .\nOver the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .\nThe patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .\nThe patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .\nAfter lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .\nThis was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .\nThe patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .\nThe procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .\nThe aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .\nThe cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .\nThe graft used was a homograft .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .\nThe immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\nThere he continued to be hemodynamically stable .\nOf note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .\nIn the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .\nOn that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .\nA number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .\nThe patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .\nAt this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .\nThe Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .\nOver the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .\nThe patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .\nThe patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .\nSubsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .\nThe patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .\nAs per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .\nHowever on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .\nGiven this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .\nThe patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .\nThis was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .\nAt the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .\nHe was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .\nHe continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .\nOn postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .\nSubsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .\nThe patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .\nThe patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .\nThese drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .\nPrior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\nThe patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .\nAs a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .\nThe patient 's condition continued to be improved .\nGiven this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .\nIn consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nGood .\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\nDiet :\nHigh calorie , high protein .\nThe patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .\nThe patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nThe patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .\nThe patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .\nThe patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .\nThe patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.\n2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .\n3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .\n4. Captopril 100 mg po three times a day .\n5. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .\n6. Albuterol nebulizers q6h as needed .\n7. Atrovent nebulizers q6h as needed .\n8. Lasix 20 mg po per day .\n9. Kay-Ciel 20 mEq po per day .\nFOLLOWUP :\nThe patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .\nThe patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .\nThe patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .\nThe patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .\nThe patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .\nDr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .\nRYNA DAU , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nNISTE MA RHALT , M.D.\nTR :\noq\nDD :\n09/13/1998\nTD :\n09/13/1998 7:18 A\ncc :\nKEND N BOTH , M.D. CARDIAC FELLOWS ROOM LOLI MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER NACO MESPRHALT , M.D. INFECTIOUS DISEASE UNIT CIL HOSPITAL RYNA R DAU , M.D. SURGICAL RESIDENT SURG AG NISTE MA RHALT , M.D. SURGERY BROTROJEUNECOCK HEALTH CHPO E ENLA GENERAL , M.D. SURGERY ON HOSPITAL STAT EDITED 09/15/1998 RJ\n", "marked_up_text": "086326823\nFIH\n6708320\n235967\n594818\n8/24/1998 12:00:00 AM\nDischarge Summary\nSigned\nDIS\n[Report Status](308552006) :\nSigned\nDISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME :\nRIEFF , ALB P\nUNIT NUMBER :\n185-64-30\nADMISSION DATE :\n08/24/1998\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n09/14/1998\nPRINCIPAL [DIAGNOSIS](439401001) :\nSternal [wound infection](76844004) .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :\n[Infected aortic graft](307394008) .\n[Hypertension](38341003) .\nPRINCIPAL [PROCEDURE](71388002) :\n08/31/98 ascending aortic root [replacement](3137001&373188003) with homograft with [omentopexy](2745006) .\nASSOCIATED [PROCEDURES](71388002) :\n09/02/98 [sternal debridement](67549005) .\nBilateral pectoralis [major](24484000) myocutaneous advancement flap .\nRight superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .\n[Primary](261424001) [closure](112695004) of [wound](13924000&416462003) .\n[HISTORY](392521001) AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :\nThe patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a [history](392521001) of an ascending aortic graft [replacement](3137001&373188003) in 1991 for aortic [dissection](122459003&5399005) .\nAt that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal [wound infection](76844004) requiring a [sternal debridement](67549005) and subsequent abdominal flap .\nThe patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive [operation](387713003) .\nThe patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a [bulge](65124004) in his sternal area .\nA [ruptured aneurysm](22039006) [or pseudoaneurysm](22036004&443089001) at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .\nThe patient then had recurrent [bleeding](131148009&50960005) two weeks later which was once again repaired .\nHowever the same [problem](55607006) recurred for a third time and a computer [tomogram](399035005) scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior [hematoma](35566002&385494008) .\nBy report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on [comfort measures](133918004) and [pain control](225782006) at the outside hospital .\nHowever the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further [evaluation](129265001) and [possible](371930009) intervention .\nThe patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr.
