:\n06/22/1991\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nMETASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .\nOPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :\nEchocardiogram times two .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nPatient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .\nPatient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .\nPathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .\nPatient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .\nOn ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .\nShe underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .\nPathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .\nThe patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .\nShe was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .\nShe was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .\nRoom air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .\nEKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .\nGiven the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .\nShe was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nAs above .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\n02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS :\nPrednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nEmaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .\nTemperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .\nHEENT :\nDry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .\nNECK :\nNo lymphadenopathy .\nCHEST :\nFew inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .\nHEART :\nRegular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .\nABDOMEN :\nWell healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .\nPELVIC :\nNo masses .\nRECTAL :\nNo masses and guaiac negative .\nEXTREMITIES :\nNo edema or cyanosis .\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\nHematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .\nPT and PTT were 12 and 26 .\nElectrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .\nThere was no evidence of tamponade .\nAn echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .\nEchocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .\nCardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .\nShe continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .\nHer steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .\nThey felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .\nShe had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .\nRoom air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .\nShe was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .\nCardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .\nEKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .\nShe should have a follow-up echocardiogram .\nEchocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .\nThoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .\nShe should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .\nShe underwent her CT scan .\nThis showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .\nPulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .\nChemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .\nShe also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .\nShe was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .\nDermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .\nThey therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .\nThe patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .\nHer cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .\nCardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .\nThey therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .\nShe had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .\nThe Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .\nShe had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .\nPsychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .\nShe was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .\nShe continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .\nDISPOSITION :\nShe will be followed by Dr. Mielke and home care services .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\nPremarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace
