Respiratory failure :\nA chest x-ray shows pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral effusions in the tracheal tube and pulmonary artery catheter in good position .\nThe PA pressures are in the 45-60 range over 20s .\nToday , I have discontinued his propofol drip , cut his fentanyl drip in half , and after a two hour pressure support have been able to wean and extubate him .\nSubsequently , I have discontinued his fentanyl completely and left him on intermittent doses of narcotics for pain control .\nHe will need to stay in the intensive care unit for pulmonary toileting .\n2. Ischemic heart disease :\n**PLACE , PA pressures have been relatively high , but stable over the course of the evening after extubation .\nHis PA pressures have increased with PA systolics in the 70s and 80s and central venous pressures around 8 .\nHis heart rate is gone from the 70s to the 90s .\nCardiac output has increased as well and is currently about 7.5 liters with a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 74% .\nGiven the fact that he appears to maintain adequate forward flow despite the elevation in his pulmonary artery pressures , I have decided to gradually diurese him over the course the day .\nI have left him on a Lasix drip , which I am titrating up in order to make sure he remains overall net negative .\nI have started some gentle beta blockade in light of his adequate cardiac output as well and we will try to get his heart rate down today .\nCurrently , he remains off heparin , but will need to be reanticoagulated shortly in light of his decreased left ventricular function and his mitral valve .\nTotal critical care time equals 40 minutes .\n___________________________________\n**NAME[WWW M.
