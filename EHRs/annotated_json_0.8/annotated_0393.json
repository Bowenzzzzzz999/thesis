23.5 in Theresa , and 3.09 - 18 .\nHer sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to 200 mg qam and 100 mg qpm in Theresa , and a review of her Union Hospital - North Shore Medical Center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9 .\nAccording to her sister , the patient has no short-term memory .\nShe has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit .\nThe patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister .\nMs. Swanson also carries a diagnosis of \" atypical MS \", which she brought with her to Dr. Billie .\nAccording to Dr. Nicole , she has had stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes .\nShe had an MRI in 2014 that showed multiple plaque-like lesions , but these were entirely stable since 2010 .\nShe is not undergoing any treatment .\nReportedly she has been evaluated at Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children , HealthSouth Braintree Rehab Hospital , and possibly St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston .\nShe has not had an LP as far as Dr. Ginger knows .\nPast Medical History :\nh/o head trauma\natypical MS\nseizures\ndepression\nhypercholesterolemia\nSocial History :\nlives in assisted living .\nSister Andrew is HCP\nFamily History :\nnot elicited\nPhysical Exam :\nICU exam :\nVS : T99.5 , BP 126/72 , HR 99 , RR 15 , SaO2 99% / RA\nGenl : lying in bed , right hand moving rhythmically , NGT in place\nMS : not following commands , withdraws to noxious stimuli , making incomprehensible vocalizations\nCN : PERRL , corneal reflex intact , nasal tickle intact , face symmetric .\nMotor : moving right hand rhythmically with occasional right face twitching as well .\nMoves all extremities to stimuli , L > R\nSensation : intact to noxious stimuli in all four extremities\nReflexes : 3+ throughout , both toes upgoing\nRecent exam :\nAfebrile , VSS\nFollowing commands , oriented to name , place .\nAble to carry on simple conversation .\nNo dysarthria , speech fluent .\nCN : PEERL , EOM full , tongue midline\nMotor : moves all extremities with some strength, improved bilaterally\nReflexes : as above\nPertinent Results :\nAdmission labs :\n2015-09-20 03:54 AM BLOOD WBC -

or extra - axial hemorrhage .\nThere is no shift of normally midline structures .\nThe ventricles are mildly prominent , but are unchanged from the prior study .\nThere is no interval loss of focal gray - white matter differentiation to suggest acute infarction , though CT is not sensitive in the early stages .\nNo focal masses is seen .\nIMPRESSION :\n1) No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect ; no significant interval change from CT of 2015-07-20 .\n2) Diffuse , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity , which may relate to an underlying demyelinating process ( as suggested in the indication provided for the prior MRI ).\nThe markedly low - attenation ( 14-15 HU ) centered within this process suggests either irreversible demyelination with cavitation (\" black hole \"), or lacunar infarction on a vascular basis .\nGeneralized and marked callosal atrophy ( on the MR ) also suggest advanced , irreversible disease .\n3) No mass is appreciated on this limited non-contrast study ; if clinically concerned , an MRI with gadolinium is recommended .\nMRI : There is a similar configuration of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , suggesting demyelinating disease .\nAs previously noted , there is associated volume loss , thinning of the corpus callosum , and slight widening of the ventricles .\nOn post-contrast images , there is a probably stable appearance of a 5 mm linear , focal area of enhancement in the left centrum semiovale , of uncertain etiology .\nAlso ehancing is 3 mm linear lesion in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly , not seen on the 08-20 MR , but that study was very motion - degraded .\nThe hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by multiple sclerosis .\nThere is no apparent mass lesion or mass effect .\nNo changes in the overall morphology of the brain are identified .\nThe surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .\nThe major vascular flow patterns are normal .\nIMPRESSION :\n1. Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter , consistent with severe demyelinating disease .\n2. Enhancing lesions in the left centrum semiovale and also left hippocampal cortex .\nThis former lesion was evident on MR dating back to 2014-08-15 , though is more prominent at this time , likely due to less motion degradation of the current scan .\nEtiology of these enhancing lesions is uncertain , but could be atypical manifestations of demyelination .\nEEG :\nABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of generalized theta and delta slowing .\nFacial twitching was described by the technologist and seen on the video .\nThis is primarily right-sided , facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the forehead or CMED CSRU .\nThere were no clear EEG correlate .\nABNORMALITY #2: The background voltages were occasionally lower on the left side , and there were additional bursts of delta slowing  seen broadly on the left side alone .\nABNORMALITY #3: The background rhythms were dominated by much faster beta rhythm .\nThey appeared to reach an 8 Hz frequency on the right at times , though the background was disorganized and slow on both sides for\nmuch of the recording .\nIt was of much lower voltage on the left .\nHYPERVENTILATION : Could not be performed .\nINTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION : Could not be performed .\nSLEEP : No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen .\nCARDIAC MONITOR : Showed a generally regular rhythm .\nIMPRESSION : Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of generalized slowing and additional left-sided slowing and voltage dimunition , along with some slowing of the background .\nThe generalized and background features indicate a wide-spread encephalopathy .\nThe left sided slowing and voltage reduction surpassed an additional dysfunction on the left side , possibly wide-spread cortical dysfunction .\nThere is a possibility of a structural lesion on the left , but the encephalopathy dominated the overall picture .\nThere were no clear epileptiform discharges .\nNo EEG correlate was established for the facial twitching .\nThe lack of EEG correlate to the facial twitching does not exclude a central cause ( and , indeed , this appeared most likely based on the clinical and video observations ).\nBrief Hospital Course :\n53 yo woman with h/o seizure disorder , demyelinating disease , and brain injury , presents with prolonged seizure , now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face .\nThis is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere , most likely the motor strip .\nIn the past , her seizures were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .\nIt is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease , but per report this has not been very active .\nOther possibilities include infection , including her UTI .\nIt is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .\nHer seizure management is difficult , given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech .\nDiscussed with Dr. Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .\nCannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .\nTopamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits .\nShe was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .\nShe was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .\nAtivan was used for breakthrough seizures ( facial twitching ).\nMRI/MRA showed new temporal lesions , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures .\nShe will need to have a repeat MRI in several months for further evaluation .\nLP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping ).\nOligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory .\nShe will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .\nPending tests :\nANGIOTENSIN 1 CONVERTING ENZYME\nEBV-PCR\nHERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS PCR\nErnest VIRUS ( JCV ) DNA PCR\nLYME , TOTAL EIA WITH REFLEX TO CSF RATIO\nVARICELLA DNA ( PCR )\nVDRL\n2. atypical MS : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( Dr. Ford in Boston Medical Center ); no current role for MS medications .\nMRI was performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left temporal lobe .\nShe also had a new lesion on her last MRI in the centrum semiovale .\nLP was done to evaluate for malignancy , and no malignant cells were seen .\nImmunotyping was negative as well ( per verbal report ).\nUnfortunately , oligoclonal bands could not be sent from the CSF ( lab sent CSF for other studies and there was not enough left over for OCB s).\nThis was relayed to the family ( Kirk ).\nGiven that she does have new lesions on MRI , if OCB s were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of MS , and it's possible she could benefit from MS therapy .\nThis was relayed to the family , and they will readdress this with Dr. Ford ( MS Hoyos ).\nThe family is confident in any decision Dr. Ford would make re : therapy for her MS .\n3. fevers on admission : Pt w/ positive U/A , treated with bactrim x 3 days with defervescence .\n4. depression : continue escitalopram ;

or extra - axial [hemorrhage](50960005&131148009) .\nThere is no shift of normally midline structures .\nThe ventricles are mildly prominent , but are [unchanged](260388006) from the prior study .\nThere is no interval loss of focal gray - white matter [differentiation](89945005) to suggest acute [infarction](55641003) , though CT is not sensitive in the early stages .\nNo focal masses is seen .\nIMPRESSION :\n[1) No intracranial hemorrhage](1386000) or [mass](4147007&300848003) effect ; no significant interval change from CT of 2015-07-20 .\n2) Diffuse , confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity , which may [relate](262094002) to an underlying demyelinating process ( as suggested in the indication provided for the prior [MRI](113091000) ).\nThe markedly low - attenation ( 14-15 HU ) centered within this process suggests either irreversible [demyelination](32693004) with [cavitation](2483006) (\" black hole \"), [or lacunar infarction](230698000) on a vascular basis .\nGeneralized and marked callosal [atrophy](13331008) ( on the MR ) also suggest advanced , irreversible [disease](64572001) .\n3) No [mass](4147007&300848003) is appreciated on this limited non-contrast study ; if clinically concerned , an [MRI](113091000) with gadolinium is recommended .\n[MRI](113091000) : There is a similar configuration of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres , suggesting demyelinating [disease](64572001) .\nAs previously noted , there is associated volume loss , thinning of the corpus callosum , and slight widening of the ventricles .\nOn post-contrast images , there is a [probably](2931005) stable appearance of a 5 mm linear , focal area of [enhancement](418393006) in the left centrum semiovale , of [uncertain](64957009) etiology .\nAlso ehancing is 3 mm linear [lesion](52988006&49755003) in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly , not seen on the 08-20 MR , but that study was very motion - degraded .\nThe hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by [multiple sclerosis](24700007&160337009) .\nThere is no apparent [mass](4147007&300848003) [lesion](52988006&49755003) or [mass](4147007&300848003) effect .\nNo changes in the overall morphology of the brain are identified .\nThe surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .\nThe [major](24484000) vascular flow patterns are normal .\nIMPRESSION :\n1. Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter , consistent with [severe](24484000) demyelinating [disease](64572001) .\n2. Enhancing [lesions](52988006&49755003) in the left centrum semiovale and also left hippocampal cortex .\nThis former [lesion](52988006&49755003) was evident on MR dating back to 2014-08-15 , though is more prominent at this time , [likely](2931005) due to less motion degradation of the current scan .\nEtiology of these enhancing [lesions](52988006&49755003) is [uncertain](64957009) , but could be atypical manifestations of [demyelination](32693004) .\n[EEG](54550000) :\nABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of generalized theta and delta slowing .\nFacial [twitching](249966004) was described by the technologist and seen on the video .\nThis is primarily right-sided , facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the forehead or CMED CSRU .\nThere were no clear [EEG](54550000) correlate .\nABNORMALITY #2: The background voltages were occasionally lower on the left side , and there were additional bursts of delta slowing  seen broadly on the left side alone .\nABNORMALITY #3: The background rhythms were dominated by much faster beta rhythm .\nThey appeared to reach an 8 Hz frequency on the right at times , though the background was disorganized and slow on both sides for\nmuch of the recording .\nIt was of much lower voltage on the left .\n[HYPERVENTILATION](68978004) : Could not be performed .\nINTERMITTENT [PHOTIC STIMULATION](258061005) : Could not be performed .\nSLEEP : No normal waking or [sleeping](248220008) morphologies were seen .\n[CARDIAC MONITOR](23852006) : Showed a generally regular rhythm .\nIMPRESSION : [Abnormal](263654008) [portable EEG](54061003) due to the bursts of generalized slowing and additional left-sided slowing and voltage dimunition , along with some slowing of the background .\nThe generalized and background features [indicate](410535002) a wide-[spread encephalopathy](51399001) .\nThe left sided slowing and voltage [reduction](289928003) surpassed an additional dysfunction on the left side , possibly wide-spread cortical dysfunction .\nThere is a possibility of a structural [lesion](52988006&49755003) on the left , but the [encephalopathy](81308009) dominated the overall picture .\nThere were no clear epileptiform discharges .\nNo [EEG](54550000) correlate was established for the facial [twitching](249966004) .\nThe lack of [EEG](54550000) correlate to the facial [twitching](249966004) does not exclude a central cause ( and , indeed , this appeared most [likely](2931005) based on the clinical and video observations ).\nBrief Hospital Course :\n53 yo woman with h/[o seizure disorder](128613002) , demyelinating [disease](64572001) , and [brain injury](127294003) , [presents](52101004&10828004) with prolonged [seizure](91175000) , now [unresponsive](422768004) with persistent [twitching](249966004) of right arm and face .\nThis is most consistent with [complex partial seizures](4103001) with a focus in the left hemisphere , most [likely](2931005) the motor strip .\nIn the past , her [seizures](91175000) were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .\nIt is [possible](371930009) that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating [disease](64572001) , but per report this has not been very active .\nOther possibilities include [infection](40733004) , including her UTI .\nIt is [likely](2931005) that these [seizures](91175000) began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .\nHer [seizure management](386418001) is [difficult](52925006&371157007) , given the higher doses were causing her to [fall](1912002) and slur her speech .\nDiscussed with Dr. Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of [tapering](257935006) down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .\nCannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .\nTopamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting [cognitive deficits](386806002) .\nShe was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .\nShe was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .\nAtivan was used for breakthrough [seizures](91175000) ( facial [twitching](249966004) ).\n[MRI](113091000)/MRA showed new temporal [lesions](52988006&49755003) , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her [seizures](91175000) .\nShe will need to have a repeat [MRI](113091000) in several months for further [evaluation](129265001) .\nLP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie [negative](260385009) [cytology](702666009) and [negative](260385009) [immunophenotyping](414466002) ).\nOligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory .\nShe will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .\nPending tests :\n[ANGIOTENSIN 1](85267009&9974009) CONVERTING ENZYME\nEBV-[PCR](702675006)\n[HERPES SIMPLEX](88594005&407450002&407451003) VIRUS [PCR](702675006)\nErnest VIRUS ( JCV ) DNA [PCR](702675006)\nLYME , TOTAL EIA WITH REFLEX TO CSF RATIO\n[VARICELLA](38907003) DNA ( [PCR](702675006) )\nVDRL\n2. atypical MS : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( Dr. Ford in Boston Medical Center );
