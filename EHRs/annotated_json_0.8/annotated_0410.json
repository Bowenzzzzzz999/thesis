trauma .\nThe patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .\nThe patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .\nPAST MEDICAL and\nSURGICAL HISTORY :\nSignificant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .\nADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :\nno known drug allergies .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nOn

.\nSGOT of 80 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nPreoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .\nThe remainder of his preoperative course was benign .\nOn July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .\nHis operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .\nPostoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .\nInitially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .\nHe developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .\nThe patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .\nHe had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .\nHe also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .\nHis immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .\nWhile in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .\nHowever , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .\nDuring the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .\nEndoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .\nHe was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .\nHe was
