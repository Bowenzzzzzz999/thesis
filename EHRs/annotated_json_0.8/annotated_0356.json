MEDIASTINITIS .\nHer vancomycin trough level today is 23 .\nI have repeated the dose of vancomycin and will watch the levels closely for the next couple of days .\nI have left her on her cefepime ; current dose is 2 grams q. 12 hours .\nWhite blood cell count is up to 23,000 today .\nPlatelets are up to 93,000 .\nShe is going to the operating room tomorrow for another debridement .\n2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE .\nChest x-ray shows some decrease in the bilateral effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion .\nI have rested her overnight on a pressure support of 20 .\nShe has been comfortable with this , with tidal volumes of around 500 to 700 and a respiratory rate of around 9 to 12 .\nToday , we have done a brief partial support trial at 5 , and she became tachypneic with a high rapid shallow breathing index .\nI have rested her back on full support .\nI suppose that she will need longer term mechanical ventilatory support until her pulmonary mechanics have improved .\n3.
