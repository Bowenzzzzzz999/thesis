heart transplantation , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , coronary graft disease , medical noncompliance .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nCardiac echocardiogram .\nOTHER PROCEDURES :\nNone .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Vessels is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure .\nMr. Vessels &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .\nRecently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in January 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .\nA repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .\nA biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .\nHe was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .\nChest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .\nPrior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .\nAn echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nNotable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , CMV infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation .\nExamination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities .\nHis blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing .\nCarotids were 2+ .\nCrackles were increased 1/4 of the way up .\nThere was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop .\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nRevealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% .\nThe electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts .\nchest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .\nThe echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .\nHydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .\nThe patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .\nAt 4:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .\nDespite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .\nUpon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .\nThe rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .\nThere were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .\nA pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .\nA transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .\nIn total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .\nThe resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .\nThe patient was pronounced dead .\nPatient &apos;s mother was informed by Dr. Vessels .\nAn autopsy permission was granted .\nDOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nNone .\nAKA
