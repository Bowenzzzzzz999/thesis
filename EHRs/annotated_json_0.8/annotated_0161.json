[presents](52101004&10828004) with acute onset right-sided [hemiparesis](20022000) and [dysarthria](8011004) , [aphasia](87486003) concerning for acute left MCA [infarct](55641003) .\nPatient arrived in Daniel within 3 hours of symptom onset and [head CT](303653007&408754009) showed no evidence of bleed .\nHowever , as wife had not seen patient before he became [symptomatic](84387000) , there was some concern that he had symptoms earlier than 6 am , and therefore would be outside the 3 hour window for TPA .\n[MRI](113091000) was performed which showed diffusion abnormalities but no hyperintensity on T2 / FLAIR [imaging](363679005) supporting the acute onset .\nTherefore , IV tpa [thrombolytics](303960004) were administered within 3 hours of symptom onset .\nWithin minutes the

taking [aspirin](387458008&7947003) and plavix , and given the [severe](24484000) akinesis of the left ventricle , we decided to initiate anticoagulation with [warfarin](372756006&48603004) to help prevent future [strokes](230690007) .\nAnticoagulation [therapy](276239002&277132007) was initiated with [heparin](372877000&84812008) and coumadin beginning on the evening of 2016-08-23 .\nThe

the Wareham VA [primary](261424001) care clinic the next morning .\nHis depakote was continued for his [bipolar disorder](13746004) .\nOn discharge , strength was nearly intact in the limbs , though he still had a right-sided facial droop .\nAdditionally , he still had mild [dysarthria](8011004) and mild [anterior aphasia](229660003) .\nAdditionally , [risk factor](80943009) modification was

[glucose](67079006&111138002) was 78 , but A1C was slightly elevated at 5.9 .\nHe may need further [glucose](67079006&111138002) monitoring in the future .\nHis home hypertensive medications were held while in the hospital to help increase cerebral [perfusion](88058003) and prevent further [ischemia](52674009) .\nThey will be restarted on discharge .\n[Speech therapy](5154007) was also consulted , and recommended oupatient [speech therapy](5154007) .\nSimilarly , outpatient PT was recommended for his [gait](63448001&271705001) difficulties from his previous [strokes](230690007) .\nResidual [deficits](47563007) include right side facial droop from previous [stroke](230690007) and moderately [severe](24484000) [dysarthria](8011004) and [anterior aphasia](229660003) with [word finding
