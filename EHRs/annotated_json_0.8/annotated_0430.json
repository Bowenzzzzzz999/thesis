Pulmonary :\nThe patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest x-ray .\nThe exact etiology of the patient 's respiratory distress was presumed to be questionable multifactorial .\nThere was concern about possible pneumonia .\nAlso she had a history of PE and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic spread of her breast CA .\nGiven her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz , Levaquin and __________ and Clindamycin .\nLab two antibiotics were added considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high risk for PCP Douglas .\nThe patient was initially trialed on BiPAP , but the patient was increasingly dyspneic , increased respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on 06-22 .\nEarlier during her Intensive Care Unit course she underwent bronchoscopy , which was sent for cytology and multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative .\nUltimately her Intensive Care Unit course continued and she began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly from BAL lavage were found to be negative .\nThe patient had multiple antibiotics withdrawn .\nClindamycin and _______________ was discontinued early in hospital course .\nHer PCP was thought to be negative .\nIn addition , Vancomycin , Levaquin were also discontinued .\nShe was later continued on Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy .\nAs the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course went on the patient 's respiratory did not show mild improvement on the ventilator .\nShe was able to oxygenate originally .\nUnfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days .\nLater in her Intensive Care Unit course family meetings took place and given the patient 's overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status it was decided that the patient would become CMO .\nSubsequently she was extubated on 06-28 .\nThe patient continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory .\nHowever , she is CMO and will not be intubated for respiratory distress .\n2. Cardiovascular :\nThe patient was initially transferred to the Intensive Care Unit thought to be exhibiting septic physiology , respiratory distress and hypotensive .\nShe required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required pressor support with neo-synephrine .\nLater during her Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back .\nIt was quite difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine .\nShe was also given stress dose steroids .\nLater in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG findings in her inferior leads .\nHer echocardiogram , however , was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55% without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology .\nAs mentioned above the patient 's hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine .\nBy 06-28 , however , the patient had been off of neo-synephrine , but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be CMO per discussion with physicians and her husband / health care proxy .\n3. Hematology :\nPatient with a history of known malignancy and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from 2012-04-23 .\nEarlier in her Intensive Care Unit course the team was concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible source of the patient 's respiratory decompensation .\nHowever , the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given risk for hemorrhage into these tumors .\nShe did have lower extremity doppler ultrasounds , which were negative .\n4. Infectious disease :\nAs mentioned above patient initially hypotension , febrile and in respiratory distress presumed to be septic source likely pulmonary .\nInitially the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin , Ceptaz , Levaquin , Clindamycin and _________.\nAll of her cultures are negative to date .\nShe was negative for PCP and subsequently _____________ was continued and Clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage .\nIn addition her Vancomycin and Levaquin were also discontinued .\nThe patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course .\nBy virtue of discussions on 06-28 the patient was deemed to be CMO and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point .\n5. Gastroenterology :\nThe patient had an abdominal CT earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course , which was essentially negative for an intraabdominal pathology .\nShe was initially supported with tube feeds during her Intensive Care Unit course , but at this point the patient is CMO and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued .\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient 's attending physician was in constant communication with the patient 's health care proxy her husband .\nAs her Intensive Care Unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement , continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status .\nUltimately it was decided by 06-28 that the patient had shown minimal improvement and minimal evidence of improvement status , it was decided at this point for the patient to be extubated and to move toward CMO care .\nSubsequently all antibiotics , blood draws and supportive blood pressure medications were withdrawn .\nCurrently she is comfortable with morphine and Ativan prn.\nCurrently plans are in the making for arranging for the patient to have home hospice care .\nPlease see discharge addendum for further developments in the patient 's care .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\n1.
