cataract on the fundoscopic examination .\nNeck was supple , bilateral bruits , although possibly radiating from cardiac base .\nThere was no jugular venous distension .\nChest demonstrated bilateral holosystolic bruits over the subclavians , left greater than right with few bibasilar crackles .\nCardiovascular examination demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 cresendo / descrecendo murmur heard best at the apex with preservation of the second heart sound , no S3 or S4 .\nAbdominal examination was soft , non-tender , non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly ,

.\nExtremity pulses revealed a right radial of 2+ , left radial of 1+ , 2+ distal pulses in the lower extremities bilaterally .\nLower extremity blood pressures demonstrated systolics of 205-210 .\nLABORATORY :\nLaboratory values on admission included a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 27 , BUN and creatinine of 39 and 1.6 respectively , glucose 113 .\nCalcium was

.\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nNegative for tobacco , negative for alcohol .\nThe patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\n1 ) Cardiovascular :\nThe patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .\nShe remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .\nThe patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .\nThe patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .\nThe patient &apos;s Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .\nThe patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .\nAt this time , the patient &apos;s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .\n2 ) Neurological / vascular :\nThe discrepancy in the patient &apos;s pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .\nThe patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .\nThe left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .\nThe patient had patent carotids bilaterally on

significant carotid disease .\nThe patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .\nThe results of these studies suggested that the patient &apos;s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .\nA Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &apos;s intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .\n3 )

fracture , likely new .\nAn Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .\nA bone scan was also obtained to rule out an

be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .\n4 ) Gastrointestinal :\nThe patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .\nThe patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .\nThe patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .\nHowever , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .\nThe patient &apos;s emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .\nThe etiology of the patient &apos;s nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .\nThe patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .\nAn attempt was also made to reduce the patient &apos;s large number of medications and the patient &apos;s Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .\n5 ) Infectious disease :\nThe patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .\nUrinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .\nThe patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .\nThe urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .\n6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :\nThe patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .\nThe patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .\nDictated By :\nBONE A , M.D. IQ35\nAttending :\nLANAY I.
