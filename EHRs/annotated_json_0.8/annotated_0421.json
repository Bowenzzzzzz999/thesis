is a patient with a prior medical history including hypothyroidism , iron-deficiency anemia , osteoporosis , increased cholesterol , peptic ulcer disease , chronic constipation , and status post appendectomy as well as status post hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .\nShe was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation and treatment of adenocarcinoma involving the transverse colon and gallbladder .\nAt the outside hospital the patient had already seemed some workup for a couple weeks duration of bilateral upper quadrant pain which occasionally radiated to her back .\nShe was also complaining of fatigue for two weeks but a good appetite and the patient denied weight loss , melena , or bright red blood per rectum .\nA CAT scan of the abdomen showed air-fluid levels in the gallbladder .\nIt also showed a thickened gallbladder wall as well as a dilated common bile duct .\nIncidentally , it also showed diverticulosis .\nA HIDA scan at the other hospital did not show filling of the gallbladder indicating some sort of\ncystic duct obstruction .\nThe first imaging study that was done at Hahnemann General Hospital was a MRCP which revealed an enhanced thickened gallbladder wall consistent with chronic cholecystitis .\nA differential according to the imaging included a fistula with adjacent inflammatory change but also carcinoma or adenomatosis .\nIn addition, also the MRCP showed a mass near the region of the neck of the gallbladder .\nOf note , at the outside hospital , an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed .\nThe colonoscopy showed two polyps and also a region in the transverse colon that was biopsied .\nThis biopsy came back as positive for adenocarcinoma .\nThe diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was already established prior to her admission at this hospital .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was scheduled for an operative date on 2014-07-29 and over the next few days she was\ngiven a low-residual diet .\nShe had her belly cleaned with Hibiclens one a day and once an adequate preoperative evaluation was performed , she was given a bowel prep on Monday afternoon and evening in preparation for an\nexploratory laparotomy on Tuesday , 2014-07-29 .\nOn the morning of 2014-07-29 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a cholecystectomy , partial hepatectomy , partial lymph node dissection , a colocolostomy , partial colectomy , and in addition a gastrostomy and a feeding jejunostomy were also put in place .\nPlease refer to the previously dictated operative notes for the details of this surgery .\nBriefly , the surgery on 2014-07-29 revealed a carcinoma of the gallbladder with a cholecystocolonic fistula which crossed into the liver as well as metastatic adenopathy around the portal nodes as well as retroperitoneal nodes around the inferior vena cava and the hepatic artery .\nIn addition to the gastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy tube , two Belmont-Gardner drains were placed .\nThe patient 's pain postoperatively was controlled with an epidural catheter .\nHowever , the epidural had the consequence of causing a bit of a hypotension in the patient and the patient was admitted to the Surgical ICU for the first postoperative day .\nIn addition , the patient had low hematocrits which required a transfusion of packed red blood cells .\nIn addition , on postoperative day number two , the patient was transferred out to the floor and she was doing better in terms of pain control on a Dilaudid PCA machine .\nOn postoperative day number two , interestingly , the patient was complaining of sensitivity to light from an unknown etiology .\nThe patient 's postoperative course was unremarkable aside from the photophobia .\nOn postoperative day number two , an Oncology consult with Dr. Natalie Mcalister was obtained and\nfollow-up appointments were scheduled with him as an outpatient .\nFollowing that , the patient was slowly advanced to clear liquids and to a regular diet once her bowels began working when she began having flatus .\nHer bowel function was slow to develop and she needed to remain n.p.o. until postoperative day number six .\nThe patient was also given supplemental tube feedings to supplement her calories and caloric intake .\nOn postoperative day number seven , the patient was tolerating her clear liquid diet and her tube feeds .\nShe was started on p.o. medicines and her first Belmont-Gardner drain was pulled due to scant output .\nBy 2014-08-09 , the patient was tolerating a full solid diet as well as her tube feeds .\nBetween the two of those , her caloric intake was sufficient for her to sustain herself .\nShe was discharged to home with services including tube feedings for her home care .\nTherefore , she was discharged on 2014-08-09 in good condition .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\n1. Metastatic gallbladder cancer .\n2. Status post cholecystectomy .\n3. Status post transverse colectomy with anastomosis .\n4. G tube placement .\n5. Feeding jejunostomy .\n6. Hypothyroidism .\n7. Blood loss requiring transfusion .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\n1. Levothyroxine 100 micrograms orally once a day .\n2. Pantoprazole one tablet once a day .\n3. Ambien 10 mg orally before bed .\n4. Tylenol # 3 one tablet every four hours as needed for pain .\n5. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at bedtime .\n6. Colace 100 mg twice a day .\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\nFollow-up with the Visiting Nurses Association to arrange assistance with her tube feeding and\nher activities of daily living .\nThe patient is also scheduled for an appointment with Dr. Patterson approximately two weeks after her discharge from the hospital .\nHeather FISCHER , M.D.\n91-657\nDictated By : Raymond Q.
