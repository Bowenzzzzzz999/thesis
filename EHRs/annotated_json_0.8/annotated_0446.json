on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nCBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .\nCoags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .\nHer gas was 7.47/40/332 .\nElectrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .\nEKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .\nCT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .\nIt was consistent with a hematoma .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nMs. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .\nThis showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .\nShe was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .\nThe differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .\nOn 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .\nA biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .\nThe operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .\nThere was no active bleeding at the time .\nOver the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .\nShe had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .\nThe ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .\nGiven these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .\nThe Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .\nAt this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .\nDr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .\nShe underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .\nShe tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .\nHer postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .\nThis required a chest tube .\nHer hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .\nIt was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .\nHowever , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .\nShe underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .\nIt turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .\nIn conclusion , by systems :\n1. Neuro .\nThe patient became intermittently agitated .\nWe have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .\nShe responds well to this .\nShe speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .\nShe has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .\nShe has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .\n2. Cardiac .\nThe patient &apos;s blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .\nThis is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\nFor this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\nHer blood pressure responds well to this .\nOtherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\nThe patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\nThis has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\nDr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\nThe aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\nThey elected not to inject it with thrombin .\nThey asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\nThey have opted for conservative management given the size .\n3. Respiratory .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\nShe seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\nHer chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\nHer right lung field is clear .\nHer tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .\nShe will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .\nWe had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .\nWith the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .\nHer oxygen saturation has always been good .\n4. GI .\nThe patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\nThis is her goal .\nShe tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .\nLast week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\nStool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\nThese have all been negative .\nWe believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\nSince her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\nShe has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\n5. GU .\nThe patient has had hypernatremia .\nShe is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\nWe believe her to still be total body overloaded .\nOver the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .\nWe also have been diuresing her with Bumex .\nThis seems to trend her sodium down .\nThis will need to be monitored closely .\nHer BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .\n6. Heme .\nAs stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .\nShe had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .\nBefore we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .\nShe had no problems with this .\nAt the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .\nI stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .\nWe have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .\nTherefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .\nShe does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .\nShe has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .\n7. ID .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .\nShe is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .\nInterestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .\nThis is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .\nWe do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .\nShe is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .\nHer Foley was changed the day before discharge .\n8. Tubes , lines , and drains .\nThe patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .\nHer central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\nAlbuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .\nCONDITION :\nStable , with active problems being respiratory failure , urinary tract infection , and bleeding diathesis .\nDISCHARGE LABS :\nOn the day of discharge , sodium 145 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 109 , bicarb 31 , creatinine 0.7 , BUN 43 , glucose 116 .\nCBC 14.9 , 29.2 ( which is stable ) , and 398 .\nPT 12 , PTT 27 , and INR 1.0 .\nMagnesium of 1.9 .\nCalcium 8.1 .\nCOMPLICATIONS :\nNone .\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient is being discharged to an acute rehab facility .\nShe should follow-up with Dr. Ryna Jescdrig as well as Dr. Lenni Lung in the Vascular Surgery Department in approximately three to four weeks .\nPlease call the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Verg Medical Center for any further details that may be needed .\nYou can also page Sta Lung , M.D. as I am the dictating physician who has been taking care of Ms. Shuffa for quite some time now .\nI would be happy to answer any questions .\nMy pager number at Verg Medical Center is number 54930 .\nDictated By :\nSTA LUNG , M.D. HU53\nAttending :\nRYNA R.
