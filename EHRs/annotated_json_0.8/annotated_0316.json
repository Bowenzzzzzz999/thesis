Respiratory insufficiency .\nChest x-ray continues to show stable bilateral infiltrates .\nLast night he was on BiPAP at a setting of 12/8 with FIO2 titrated to maintain oxygen saturations of greater than 94% .\nHe was unable to tolerate any time off the BiPAP yesterday .\nThis morning I have taken him off the BiPAP and he has done well on a nonrebreather face mask through most of the day but is becoming somewhat tachypneic later in the afternoon and I plan to place him back on BiPAP at these same settings overnight .\nHe is diuresing reasonably well and I have discontinued his Lasix drip and changed him to Lasix 40 mg q. 12 hourly in order to keep him overall net negative .\nWe will watch his BUN and creatinine closely which are at 20 and 0.7 today and his bicarbonate is up to 33 .\n2.
