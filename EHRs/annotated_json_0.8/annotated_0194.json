Grade II / V laceration of liver ,\n2. rupture of left renal vein ,\n3. tear of transverse mesocolon ,\n4. serosal tear of transverse colon ,\n5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE :\nMr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver .\nThe patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him .\nHe was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain .\nHe had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew .\nIntravenous fluids was given .\nHe was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds .\nHe arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 .\nLarge bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid .\nHe had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended .\nHis hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 .\nThe abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood .\nHis blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .\nAt laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .\nThere was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .\nControl of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided &quot; Mattox &quot; maneuvers were performed .\nThe retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .\nThis was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .\nThe vein was divided and suture ligated .\nBleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .\nThe tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .\nThe examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .\nThe patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\nThe patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer &apos;s lactate .\nAn intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .\nIntracranial pressures were normal .\nThat day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .\nAn arch aortogram was normal .\nOver the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .\nThe patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 4 .\nThree liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .\nExploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .\nBecause of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .\nFour large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .\nThe patient &apos;s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .\nHowever , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .\nHe was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .\nContinuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient &apos;s course .\nVancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .\nHe was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .\nTotal parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .\nInitial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .\nThe patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .\nIt was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .\nThe abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .\nTracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .\nThere was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .\nThe subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .\nOn July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .\nOn July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .\nHis blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nSevere blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\n1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,\n2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,\n3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas ,\n4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 ,\nCOMPLICATIONS :\nSevere necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nN / A.\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nN / A.\nESTIMATED DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :\nN / A.\nDISPOSITION :\nMason Street .\nRISSPA BREATH , M.D.\nTR :\nun / bmot\nDD :\n08-07-93\nTD :\n08/08/93\nCC :\n", "marked_up_text": "280594741\nFIH\n7060363\n70349/v957\n068215\n7/2/1993 12:00:00 AM\n[SEVERE](24484000) BLUNT ABDOMINAL [TRAUMA](19130008&417746004) .\nUnsigned\nDIS\n[Report Status](308552006) :\nUnsigned\nADMISSION DATE :\n7-2-93\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n7-30-93\nPRINCIPAL [DIAGNOSIS](439401001) :\n[Severe](24484000) blunt abdominal [trauma](19130008&417746004) .\nASSOCIATED [DIAGNOSIS](439401001) :\n1.
