in fact , he was slightly pink .\nHe was not flushed .\nThere was no skin rash .\nHis neurologic exam was intact .\nHis lungs were clear bilaterally .\nHis heart rate was rapid and regular .\nHis abdomen was slightly distended and reported as not being different from previous .\nIt was nontender .\nThere was no rebound .\nThere were bowel sounds .\nHe had no peripheral edema and no acrocyanosis .\nWe checked the patient 's morning labs which had been drawn only several hours earlier and noted no significant abnormalities .\nI did note that the white blood cell count had increased from roughly 3000 to roughly 5000 .\nWe drew a blood gas which was not abnormal , and I decided to treat the patient 's hypertension and tachycardia with Lopressor .\nI dosed him 2.5 mg every 3 minutes or so , giving him ultimately a total dose of 25 mg .\nWith this intervention , the patient 's pulse decreased from 146 down to 115 .\nHis blood pressure decreased down to 142/80 .\nHis respiratory rate decreased from 46 to 30 and the patient said that he did feel more comfortable with his breathing after the infusion of these medicines .\nThe surgery resident ordered 4 grams of magnesium which was infused as well .\nWe were concerned that this may be a medication event; however , the patient has only received Dilaudid since midnight .\nHe has tolerated Dilaudid well in the past and this did not appear to be a histamine reaction in any case , so I discount this as a possibility .\nI was able to rapidly wean the patient 's FiO2 down to 4 liters of nasal cannula with 100% saturation .\nHe had no pulmonary complaints , so I do not believe pulmonary embolus is a cause .\nIt appears rather that this was some sort of catecholamine storm .\nI am unclear as to the etiology but my best suspicion is that he may be having incipient sepsis .\nHis temperature is 38.5 .\nThere has been a bump in his white count and this occurred about an hour or so after having his biliary duct catheter flushed .\nI spoke to the surgery fellow and we agreed to resume treatment with antibiotics .\nI have asked for either Zosyn or Unasyn along with Flagyl , treating abdominal pathogens as well as C. difficile .\nThe patient has been complaining of diarrhea .\nA CT scan has also been ordered by us , looking for an abdominal fluid collection which , if found , should be tapped .\nI have moved the patient to the Intensive Care Unit because of his vital sign abnormalities and because it is unclear to me what the etiology of such a severe vital sign derangement is .\nA chest x-ray has been ordered and has only just been taken ;
