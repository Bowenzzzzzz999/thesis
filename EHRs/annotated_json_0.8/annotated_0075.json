Hypertension .\n2. Anemia of chronic disease .\n**INSTITUTION ADMISSION :\nThis is a **AGE[in 60s]- year - old female who presents with multiple generalized complaints of fatigue , weakness , headache , weight loss , shortness of breath , palpitations , muscle aches , numbness , and tingling who was recently hospitalized with low - grade fevers and leukocytosis for which an extensive workup was undertaken with no source or etiology of her leukocytosis or symptoms identified .\nThis workup included a tagged white blood cell scan , a EMG , and a PET scan .\nOf note , the patient was scheduled to have an outpatient temporal artery biopsy , but failed to follow up with this appointment .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\n1. Giant cell arteritis .\nThe patient carried a questionable diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus for which she had not been treated recently .\nGiven her multiple complaints and history of vitiligo , we continued to pursue an autoimmune explanation for her constellation of symptoms .\nWe did obtain a Rheumatology consult who recommended temporal artery biopsy while an inpatient .\nThe patient underwent temporal artery biopsy on **DATE[Sep 10 2007] .\nThe procedure was a bilateral temporal artery biopsy and was without complications .\nPathology performed on this specimen was consistent with giant cell arteritis .\nThe patient was started on prednisone 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was scheduled for followup with Rheumatology .\n2. Dizziness .\nThe patient continued to complain of significant dizziness , which appeared to be positional in nature .\nHer symptoms and signs are most consistent with benign positional vertigo , but given Rheumatology 's assessment that she had some asymmetric sensory abnormality on exam , we evaluated the patient with MRA of the internal auditory canals which revealed nonspecific signal changes seen in the pons in the hemispheric white matter consistent with small vessel disease .\nNo specific evidence of intracanicular acoustic neuroma was identified .\nThe patient is to have followup with **INSTITUTION .\n3.
