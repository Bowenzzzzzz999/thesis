.\nMultiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .\nThe patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been

chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\nHer steroids were weaned .\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\nShe remained in a coma .\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\nThe urine contained yeast and she was
