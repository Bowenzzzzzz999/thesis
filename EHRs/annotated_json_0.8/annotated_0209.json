NEUROLOGY :\nMr. Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay .\nUpon arrival , Neurosurgery promptly placed V. Holtzen bolt .\nThis allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure .\nNotably , intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed .\nDuring his hospitalization , his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 .\nTo do this , mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used .\nWhile using mannitol , his serum osmolalities were followed closely .\nIn addition , to monitoring his intracranial pressure , his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmHg .\nA parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization .\nMr. Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and / or morphine boluses for pain .\nNeurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination .\nDuring his hospitalization , two subsequent CAT scans were obtained ; one on hospital day two .\nThis CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed .\nAfter a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery , the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant , and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition .\nHis intracranial pressure remained stable , and his clinical examination was unchanged .\nAn additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three .\nThis examination was unchanged from the previous examination .\nAgain , his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same , and conservative treatment was opted for .\n2. CARDIOVASCULAR :\nAs described in previous section , Neo-Synephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 .\nA pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four .\nThis catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support .\nPlease see Infectious Disease section for more details .\n3. GASTROINTESTINAL :\nMr. Roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission .\nA orogastric tube was passed .\nInitially during admission , carafate was given down the orogastric tube .\nHowever , on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three , a mediastinum was noted .\nThis raised the question of potential esophageal rupture .\nGastroenterology was consulted for this .\nGastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status .\nAt this point , his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly n.p.o.\n4. HEMATOLOGY :\nThroughout Mr. Richard admission , his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s .\nAs will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section , he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis , and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 .\nMr. Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis .\nHe was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage .\nAn inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred , as it was felt that Mr. Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure .\n5. ENDOCRINE :\nMr. Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale .\n6. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :\nMr. Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers .\nHis blood urine and sputum were all cultured .\nBlood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative Staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 .\nHis preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew Escherichia coli .\nSputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods , not yet speciated , and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes .\nThroughout this time , Mr. Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four , his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade .\nDuring his hospitalization , his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods , imipenem , and Flagyl .\nInitially , he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain , but his cultures became positive , and his white blood cell count increased .\nHe was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl .\nVancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture .\nWith a fever of 102 , up to 42 degrees centigrade , aggressive measures including cooling blankets , alcohol swabs , and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down .\nHypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion , paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering .\n7. PULMONARY :\nAs discussed in the Infectious Disease section , Mr. Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms , but most likely from Escherichia coli .\nFor this pneumonia , he was placed empirically on imipenem , vancomycin , and Flagyl .\nOn hospital day three , Mr. Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea .\nFor this , a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism .\nOn hospital day four , a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax .\nFor this , a left #34 Caucasian chest tube was placed .\nOn the evening of hospital day four , Mr. Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole .\nUrgent resuscitation measures were initiated .\nThe measures included attempts at pacing .\nEpinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium .\nHe had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , and pulmonary embolism .\nDuring the resuscitation afterwards , it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest , so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest .\nThere was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression , and a right chest tube was placed .\nDuring this time , a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back .\nA left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present .\nAfter 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage , there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors .\nResuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 .\nAfter the termination of resuscitation , both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient 's family members including his next of kin , his mother .\nPermission for a postmortem examination was granted .\nMatthew M.
