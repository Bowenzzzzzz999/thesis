percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nCoronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nMetoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\nHe had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .\nHe was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .\nThe patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q&apos;s in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.\nOn physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .\nThe cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .\nHe had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA &apos;d to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\nHe also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB&apos;s .\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .\nHe had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\nOn day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\nOn day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\nTherefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\nThe patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\nHowever , he did not keep any of these appointments .\nHe went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\nOn the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\nHe came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .\nHe was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .\nCARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\nHis cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nHis past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\nHis past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nOn admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .\nHABITS :\nThe patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .\nThe HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .\nThe pupils equal , round , reactive to light .\nThe oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .\nThere were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .\nThe neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\nThe carotids were 1+ without bruits .\nThe heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\nThe lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\nThe abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\nThe liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\nThere was no splenomegaly .\nThe femoral pulses were diminished .\nHe had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .\nThe extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nThe pulses were 1+ bilaterally .\nThe skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .\nThe rectal examination was guaiac negative .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nThe laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .\nThe portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .\nThe electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA &apos;d , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient &apos;s daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient &apos;s compliance .\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future
