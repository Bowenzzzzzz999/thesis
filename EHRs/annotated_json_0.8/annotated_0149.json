no seizure activity was seen .\nThis medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up , with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05 .\nHead CT repeated on 03-30 was unchanged , and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift ) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia .\nThe plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor , but the hospital was full and he never got a bed .\nCardiovascularly , lipitor and amiodarone were continued .\nHe could not get an MRI due to his pacemaker .\nThere were no telemetry events , and he ruled out by enzyme .\nPulmonlologically , his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems .\nEndocrinologically , BG was monitored to improve outcome in ICU setting though he had no history of DM .\nOf note , Hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( \" borderline DM \" ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge .\nIns / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen , VD boots and PUD prophylaxis with protonix during the admission .\nWalking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet .\nPT was asked to see him for this gait problem .\nBrandon felt well and was seen by PT who suggested a rehab/Hahnemann Hospital ( Worcester ) to work on walking with the eventual goal of returning to assisted living with his wife when walking improved .\nFollow-up was arranged with neurosurgery in 5-6 weeks with repeat head ct to be arranged by neurosurgery office to make sure blood has cleared , and if indicated , to look for a possible underlying lesion ( although unlikely ) .\nMedications on Admission :\nAmiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig : 0.5 Tablet PO qod - in March , should be on odd days .\nDonepezil 5 mg Tablet Sig : Two ( 2 ) Tablet PO HS ( at bedtime ) .\nDocusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig : One ( 1 ) Capsule PO BID ( 2 times a day ) .\nMultivitamin Capsule Sig : One ( 1 ) Cap PO DAILY ( Daily ) .\nMirtazapine 30 mg Tablet Sig : 0.5 Tablet PO HS ( at bedtime ) .\nAtorvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO at bedtime .\nOcuvite Tablet Sig : One ( 1 ) Tablet PO once a day .\nArtificial Tears Drops Sig : One ( 1 ) drop Ophthalmic twice a day : ou .\nEnsure Liquid Sig : 0.5 to 1 can PO three times a day .\nMidodrine 10 mg Tablet Sig : 1.5 Tablets PO twice a day : at 8am and noon .\nRitalin 5 mg Tablet Sig : see below Tablet PO see below : 1.5 tablets at 10am ( 7.5mg ) , 1 tablet 2pm ( 5mg ) .\nPrilosec 20 mg Capsule , Delayed Release ( E.C. ) Sig : One ( 1 ) Capsule , Delayed Release ( E.C. ) PO once a day .\nGuaifenesin 100 mg / 5 mL Liquid Sig : 01-28 teaspoons PO every six ( 6 ) hours as needed for cold symptoms .\nDischarge Medications :\n1.
