Chronic kidney disease .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThis is a **AGE[in 60s]- year-old , white female admitted with a history of progressive cough , chills , fever , and progressive dyspnea .\nThe patient had the onset of symptoms three weeks prior to admission .\nThe patient presented to the Emergency Department with the above symptoms .\nOutpatient therapy with doxycycline failed , and admission to the hospital was deemed necessary .\nBlood cultures wound up being positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae .\nOf note is that the patient had a productive cough of green-yellow sputum , chills , fever , and rigors .\nTemperature in the Emergency Department was 101.5 .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nPositive for poorly controlled , type 2 diabetes mellitus , obesity , multifactorial anemia , and chronic kidney disease .\nALLERGIES :\nPENICILLIN AND LEVAQUIN .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nLasix , Desyrel , Cozaar , and Avandaryl .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\nPositive for coronary artery bypass graft , two-vessel .\nThere was also a surgery on the breast .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nVITAL SIGNS :\nBlood pressure 136/57 , cardiac rate 90 , respirations 20 , and temperature 101.5 .\nPulse

cardiomegaly .\nThere was mild pulmonary vascular congestion .\nThe recheck chest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 23 07] , showed minimal improvement in that left upper lobe pneumonia .\nThe next chest x-ray showed evidence of excellent PICC line placement .\nThe lungs were hypoinflated .\nOn **DATE[Mar 24 07] , there was a persistent left upper lobe infiltrate .\nThere was bilateral atelectasis or perhaps infiltrate , left lung base .\nChest x-ray on **DATE[Mar 25 07] , showed left lower lobe atelectasis .\nNo significant change in that left upper lobe infiltrate .\nLABORATORY :\nAdmit white count was 22,300 with 81 segs , 1 band , and 8 lymphs .\nHemoglobin was 8.1 , and platelets were 239,000 .\nAfter transfusion , the CBC on **DATE[Mar 21 07] , showed a white count of 19,400 with 61

final BMP was normal .\nTSH was normal at 1.18 .\nThe blood culture showed Streptococcus pneumoniae on several occasions .\nThis was sensitive to vancomycin , moxifloxacin , levofloxacin , penicillin , and ceftriaxone .\nIt was resistant to other antibiotics .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the regular floor under the care of Dr. **NAME[UUU TTT] , and he stabilized the patient .\nAt Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's request , I assumed care of the patient and continued Dr. **NAME[TTT] 's overall therapy .\nWe felt that the blood sugar should be better controlled , and we resumed the home dose of glipizide , but we utilized metformin instead of Avandia to avoid the fluid retention and other side effects of the thiazolidinediones .\nAlso , weight loss hopefully would be a positive event in this morbidly obese patient .\nWe discontinued the IV fluids but also switched from IV to oral Lasix .\nRocephin 1 gram IV daily was instituted .\nThe Mefoxin was 850 mg b.i.d.\nA PICC line had to be inserted on **DATE[Mar 23 07] , for difficulty maintaining vascular access .\nThe patient , in general , was very stable and slowly improved .\nHer temperature went down nicely .\nOn **DATE[Mar 26 07] , the patient appeared to be doing very well .\nBlood sugar was 208 .\nWe were able to switch from IV Rocephin to the oral fluoroquinolone agent Cipro in view of the sensitivities .\nThere was no
