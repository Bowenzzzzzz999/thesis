Neutra-Phos .\nALLERGIES :\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nHalf pack per day of tobacco times 20 years , alcohol about two 24 ounce beers per week .\nDrugs :\nDenied IV drug abuse .\nHe lives with his wife who has a baby with another boyfriend of two years .\nHe recently came out as bisexual to his wife .\nThe wife and the patient have two children together .\nHe was fired as a Federal Express worker recently and his wife kicked the patient out of his home on 2010-08-27 .\nFAMILY HISTORY :\nGrandmother with diabetes .\nMother with asthma .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER : Vital signs :\nT maximum 98.6 , blood pressure 90s-130s / 80s-90s , heart rate 70s to 80s , respirations 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air .\nGeneral :\nThe patient was a soft-spoken male resting in his bed in no acute distress .\nHEENT :\nThe pupils were equally round and reactive to light .\nExtraocular muscles were intact .\nSclerae were anicteric .\nMoist mucous membranes , clear oropharynx .\nNeck :\nSupple , no masses , no lymphadenopathy .\nCardiovascular :\nRegular rate , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\nNormal S1 , S2 .\nPulmonary :\nClear to auscultation bilaterally .\nAbdomen :\nNormoactive bowel sounds , soft , mildly tender at right upper quadrant just inferior to the lower ribs , no epigastric tenderness .\nExtremities : Warm and well perfuse .\nNormal peripheral pulses .\nNeurologic :\nCranial nerves II through XII were intact .\nNormal sensation .\nNormal motor strength bilaterally .\nPsychiatric :\nDepressed affect .\nDenied suicidal ideation .\nLABORATORY / RADIOLOGIC DATA :\nCBC with a white count of 6.2 , hemoglobin 13.3 , hematocrit 39.4 , platelet 307,000 .\nSodium 142 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 104 , bicarbonate 30 , BUN 7 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 41 .\nCalcium 9.6 , magnesium 2.2 , phosphorus 7.4 , vitamin B12 level 320 , folate 9.5 , TSH 1.4 , acetone negative .\nSerum tox screen , alcohol 32 mg per deciliter , negative for aspirin , benzos , barbiturates , and TCA .\nUrine tox screen negative for benzos , barbiturates , opiates , cocaine , amphetamines , and methadone .\nTelemetry was notable for episodes of sinus tachycardia to 120s to 140s only .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\n1. HYPOGLYCEMIA :\nThe patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin ; however , with glucose repletion both in the Emergency Department and in the ICU , this resolved and the patient also began to eat .\nWe checked fingerstick glucoses q.i.d. and at 3:00 a.m.\nHis glucose on the morning of discharge was about 60 so we opted to decrease his p.m. NPH dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin .\nHe should also continue having a snack at midnight if able .\nIt is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with Richard Natalie diet .\n2. ALCOHOL ABUSE :\nIt is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits .\nHe did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in 2009-09-03 .\nHe had been on a diazepam CIWA scale prophylaxis against DT s; however , he had a very low CIWA scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines .\nThis alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the Psychiatry Quincy Medical Center .\nWe had also requested a Social Work consult regarding this .\n3. DEPRESSION vs. Borderline personality disorder :\nThe patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life , it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth .\nHe received a one-to-one sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the Psychiatry HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital to ensure the patient 's safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment .\nHe will need close follow-up regarding his depression as an outpatient , although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through .\n4. HISTORY OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE :\nHis blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of 130s systolic during his admission , thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past .\n5. RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN :\nWe obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as LFTs , amylase , and lipase which were all normal .\nHe had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys .\nit is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause .\n6. PROPHYLAXIS :\nHe was put on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis .\n7. FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES , AND NUTRITION :\nHe complied with Linda Chad diet while hospitalized .\nThe patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of Neutra-Phos during his ICU stay .\nHe was given two doses of calcium carbonate 1 gram , and will most likely normalize secondary to both calcium binding and urinary excretion .\nHe has been asymptomatic .\nDISCHARGE CONDITION :\nStable .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\n1.
