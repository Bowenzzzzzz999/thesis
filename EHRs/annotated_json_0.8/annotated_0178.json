The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .\nHematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .\nThe MCV is 88 .\nThe prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .\nThe urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .\nThe CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .\nThe urine sodium was 147 .\nThe serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .\nAn I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .\nThe abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .\nChest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .\nHe was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .\n1-Rhabdomyolysis .\nThe patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .\nThis resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .\nThe patient &apos;s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .\nThe aldolase was positive at 142 .\nThis was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .\nThe patient &apos;s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .\nThe patient &apos;s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .\nNevertheless , the patient &apos;s renal failure continued to progress .\nOver the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .\nMuch of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .\n2-Renal failure .\nThe creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .\nThe urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .\nPeritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .\nSubsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .\nHe continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .\n3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .\nOn admission the patient &apos;s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .\nHe went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .\nThe patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .\nHis DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .\n4-Septic shock .\nThe patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .\nHe was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .\nHemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .\nHe had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .\nThis will be discussed below .\nFurther he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .\nAn echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .\nHis ejection fraction was 55% .\nOn 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .\n5-Hepatic failure .\nHis SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .\nHe had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .\nHe was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .\nGiven his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .\n6-Cocaine intoxication .\nSerum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nFurther , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .\nThis is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .\n7-Pneumonia .\nThe patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .\nThe first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .\nHe subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .\nHe was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .\n8-Pancreatitis .\nThe amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .\nAlthough not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .\n9-Catheter tip infections .\nThe patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .\nThese were treated with Vancomycin .\n10-Anemia .\nThe patient &apos;s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .\n11-Coma .\nThe patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .\nA CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .\nThe lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent coagulopathy .\nThe patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .\nFurther complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .\nDespite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .\nMid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .\nThe patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .\nNevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nCocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nPeritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition .\nCOMPLICATIONS DURING ADMISSION :\nNeck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion ,

failure](59927004) .\nAn [echocardiogram](40701008) on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly [hypokinetic](255385008) with no [vegetations](264340003&363564008) .\nHis ejection fraction was 55% .\nOn 4/16 the [pulmonary artery catheter](422463007) was placed which revealed a wedge [pressure](13543005) of 8 , [cardiac index](54993008) of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .\n[5-Hepatic failure](59927004) .\nHis SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .\nHe had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with [dependence](255338002) on [transfusion](5447007) for [support](243114000) of his [prothrombin](7348004) time .\nHe was seen in [consultation](11429006) by the GI Service and the Liver [Transplantation](77465005) Service .\nGiven his multiple other medical [problems](55607006) , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing [substance abuse](66214007) at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver [transplantation](77465005) .\n[6-Cocaine intoxication](27956007) .\nSerum Cocaine was [positive](10828004) 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nFurther , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were [positive](10828004) .\nThis is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive [rhabdomyolysis](240131006&89010004) and [hepatic failure](59927004) .\n7-Pneumonia .\nThe patient developed two [pneumonias](233604007) with two [separate](13184001) organisms .\nThe first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with [Ciprofloxacin](372840008&7577004) and Gentamicin .\nHe subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus [pneumonia](233604007) which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his [renal failure](42399005) .\nHe was seen in [consultation](11429006) by the [Infectious Disease Service](3541000175108&310054005) who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .\n[8-Pancreatitis](75694006) .\nThe [amylase](387031005&713358006&116534006) on admission was 279 with a [lipase](72993008&116535007) of 161 .\nAlthough not fully this may have contributed to his [hypocalcemia](5291005) and volume requirements .\n9-Catheter tip [infections](40733004) .\nThe patient grew out coagulase [negative](260385009) staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound [hypertension](38341003) .\nThese were treated with Vancomycin .\n10-Anemia .\nThe patient &apos;s [hematocrit](28317006&365616005) was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of [packed red blood cells](431069006) over the course of his hospitalization .\n11-Coma .\nThe patient , although initially minimally [responsive](422768004) , went on to develop a deep [comatose](371632003) state .\nA CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of [hemorrhage](50960005&131148009) though he did have sphenoid [sinusitis](36971009) .\nThe [lumbar puncture](277762005) and [sinus](419351001) [exploration](122458006&122460008&281615006) were [unable](371151008) to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent [coagulopathy](64779008) .\nThe patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for [meningitis](7180009) and [sinusitis](36971009) .\nFurther complicating this was his profound [liver failure](59927004) with rising [ammonias](43953005&421024009) [and hepatic encephalopathy](13920009) .\nDespite maximal [supports](243114000) the patient continued to be hypotensive .\nMid-way through his hospital course he developed [trilobar pneumonia](278516003) and this was [probably](2931005) complicated further by [adult respiratory distress syndrome](67782005) and the multi-organ system failure [syndrome](64572001) .\nThe patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .\nNevertheless , he developed refractory [hypoxemia](389087006) , [hypotension](45007003) , and ultimately the [patient died](397709008) despite total [life support](78823007) .\nDISCHARGE [DIAGNOSIS](439401001) :\n[Cocaine intoxication](27956007) , [rhabdomyolysis](240131006&89010004) , [renal failure](42399005) , [disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic](67406007) [shock](27942005) , [hepatic failure](59927004) , [pneumonia](233604007)
